            <p>The writer of Revelation in our second lesson today calls Jesus Christ “the faithful witness,” the one who sees, and knows, and shares with others the experience of the love of God in his life. As we follow in Jesus’ footsteps in our walk through life, we too are called to be faithful witnesses, testifying to the truth of God’s love in the here and now. As Christ Jesus announced to his disciples just prior to his ascension, according to the author of the Acts of the Apostles, “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” (1:8)</p>
            <p>Our new Presiding Bishop, the Most Rev. Michael Curry, in his installation sermon, stressed the importance of evangelism in the Church’s mission. He was reiterating our call to be faithful witnesses for Christ Jesus. That doesn’t mean we all will be called to go door-to-door sharing our faith, though some may be. It doesn’t mean that we are all called to stand on the street corner with an open Bible in our hand, testifying to any who will listen, though some may be. Nor are all called to be foreign missionaries serving in the uttermost parts of the earth, but no doubt, some will be. Whenever, wherever we do have the opportunity to witness to our faith, we can rely on Jesus’ promise, “. . . do not worry beforehand about what you are to say; but say whatever is given you at that time, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.” (Mk.13:11b)</p>
            <p>Our witness, however, need not always be spoken. We are called to show forth in our lives what we believe in our hearts, letting God’s love shine through us to all we meet.</p>
