            <p>Jesus’ parable in today’s gospel demonstrates that when things are going well, it is easy to assume that we are doing all the right things and can take credit for our success. As long as life goes on as usual day by day, we assume that all is well, that we have nothing to worry about, no reason to make any changes in our lives. It is easy for us to ignore what is going on right under our noses.</p>
            <p>When I consulted with companies about their safety and health programs, we called that kind of behavior, unaware, not paying attention, asleep at the switch, being on automatic pilot People on automatic pilot in the workplace are a danger to themselves and others. They are not alert to potential hazards and are likely to walk right into trouble. Someone has to get their attention before it’s too late.</p>
            <p>In the Hebrew scriptures, God used the prophets to get the people’s attention, to call them back into the Way of the Lord. Jesus used a parable to wake up his audience, to shake them out of their complacency. Some of them heard him and turned off their automatic pilot switch. Others assumed that Jesus wasn’t talking to them and went on their merry way, thereby missing what Timothy’s mentor calls “the life that really is life”.</p>
            <p>What about you? Are you on automatic pilot, ignoring the Lazarus at your gate?</p>
