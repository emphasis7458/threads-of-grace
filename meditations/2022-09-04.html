<p>Whenever I read the Jeremiah passage appointed for today, the hymn “Have Thine Own Way” with its potter and clay image comes to mind:</p>
<p>“Have thine own way, Lord, have thine own way.</p>
<p>Thou art the potter; I am the clay.</p>
<p>Mold me and make me after thy will</p>
<p>While I am waiting, yielded and still.”</p>
<p>Long ago and far away, when I was in the second grade, we started each school day pledging allegiance to the flag of our country standing tall in a corner of the room. That was followed by singing a patriotic song such as “America” or “America the Beautiful,” or “God Bless America.” Then there was a passage of scripture read and a hymn sung, (Bear in mind that back in the day, it was a different time, a different culture—WWII was going on; my father was overseas serving in the Navy.) That year the hymn was often “Have Thine Own Way.” I’m sure there were others, but they haven’t stayed with me. I don’t remember if the teacher had us memorize the hymn (memorization was an important learning tool in those days) or if we just learned it by frequent repetition—in any case, it settled in my core. Over the years, the hymn has touched me in different ways at different times. Since midlife, it has become especially meaningful as I have come to recognize and experience God’s transforming hand at work in my life. That started with the call to surrender, to let go of my control issues, right in tune with those lyrics. Then moving into contemplative prayer, sitting in silence, resting in the presence of God, has enabled me to respect, relate to, and enjoy the aspects of “waiting, yielded and still”—all far different from anything a seven-year-old could have imagined or anticipated.</p>
<p>Try using the hymn as a prayer, trusting the Potter to rework you day by day, however you may need, body, mind, spirit.</p>
