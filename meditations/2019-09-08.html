            <p>The Jeremiah passage appointed for today reminds me of the old gospel hymn “Have Thine Own Way, Lord” written by Adelaide A. Pollard in 1907:</p>
            <p>“Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!</p>
            <p>Thou art the Potter; I am the clay.</p>
            <p>Mold me and make me after Thy will,</p>
            <p>While I am waiting yielded and still.</p>
            <p>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!</p>
            <p>Search me and try me, Master, today!</p>
            <p>Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,</p>
            <p>As in Thy presence humbly I bow.</p>
            <p>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!</p>
            <p>Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!</p>
            <p>Power, all power, surely is Thine!</p>
            <p>Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.</p>
            <p>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!</p>
            <p>Hold o’er my being absolute sway!</p>
            <p>Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see</p>
            <p>Christ only, always, living in me.”</p>
            <p>In elementary school in the 1940’s. we started each day with “opening exercises” which included the Pledge of Allegiance , perhaps a patriotic song, “America”, for example, then likely a scripture passage such as the 23^(rd) Psalm, and maybe a hymn. When I was in the second grade, we learned “Have Thine Own Way, Lord”. We must have sung it often because this is the only hymn I remember from those early school years. For some reason it has been a pillar for me over the years. My heart must have been ready to receive it even at that early age. Perhaps yours is today.</p>
