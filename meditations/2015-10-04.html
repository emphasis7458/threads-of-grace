            <p>The scripture phrase that grabbed my attention today comes from the psalmist (26:8): “Lord, I love the house in which you dwell and the place where your glory abides.” Where the psalmist pictured the abiding place of God’s glory was likely on the golden mercy seat covering the ark of the covenant (Ex.25:10-22), first housed in the tabernacle that traveled with the Israelites through the wilderness and later in the Jerusalem temple built by Solomon. In our epistle lesson the writer to the Hebrews a thousand or so years later found God’s glory in Christ Jesus, “in the reflection of God’s glory and the imprint of God’s very being.” Pause for a moment and consider where God’s glory abides for you, when and how you experience the Divine Presence manifesting in the here and now. For some, it will likely be creation that opens our eyes to God’s glory. Sunrise and sunset, the ebb and flow of the tides here on the coast are daily reminders of the constancy of God’s love. The stars in the night sky drawing our attention to the vastness of the cosmos demonstrate the magnitude of that Love. All around us, flora and fauna may speak to us of the glory of the Creator, the Source and Essence of all. Traditionally, many experience God’s glory in the houses dedicated to the worship of the Divine, from the largest, most grandiose cathedrals to the tiniest of wayside chapels, in the crosses erected to bring us to remembrance of God’s self-giving love, in the bread and wine consecrated on the altar to fill us with the Incarnation of Divine Love, in those “thin places” where we find kairos crossing over into chronos. Others discover the glory of God dwelling in human beings, witness all those we recognize to be saints, canonized or not. The apostle Paul has pointed out “. . . that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you,” (I Cor.3:16) and “. . . God’s temple is holy and you are that temple.” (ICor.3:17b) Each of us and all of us, whether we know it or not, whether we show it or not, have God indwelling us and enfolding us (“in whom we live and move and have our being,” Acts 17:28) and all creation with the glory of Divine Love. May we awaken to God’s glorious presence in our lives, within and without, this day and forever more.</p>
