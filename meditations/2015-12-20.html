            <p>The prophet Micah in our lesson from the Hebrew Scriptures is looking forward to the coming of the Messiah as he promises that “he shall be the one of peace.” We know that Promised One as Christ Jesus, whom we also call the Prince of Peace, as we look forward to his coming again in glory. We need only look around us to see that his reign can’t yet have begun to be realized—we obviously continue to live in the “not yet” time.</p>
            <p>As I was pondering “the one of peace,” I saw a TV Christmas commercial with a group singing “Let There Be Peace on Earth, and Let It Begin with Me” by Sy Miller and Jill Jackson. “Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me. Let there be peace on earth, the peace that was meant to be! With God as our Father, brothers all are we. Let me walk with my brother in perfect harmony.</p>
            <p>Let peace begin with me; let this be the moment now. With ev’ry breath I take, let this be my solemn vow: To take each moment and live each moment in peace eternally! Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me!”</p>
            <p>It inspired me to share it with you and ask if you are ready to make this your solemn vow, “to take each moment and live each moment in peace eternally,” to join in bringing the reign of the Prince of Peace to reality here and now?</p>
