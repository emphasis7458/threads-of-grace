            <p>Sunday by Sunday, the lectionary gives us four lessons, one from the Hebrew scriptures, a Psalm (song) in response, a passage from an Epistle, and one from one of the Gospels. Take time to notice the list of today’s lessons. Rather than a selection from the Psalter, there is a reading from Lamentations. When we read that passage, we find it is indeed a psalm, a song of lament over the destruction of Jerusalem at the time of the Babylonian exile with the hope of God’s restoration. In fact, the entire book of Lamentations is a small psalter for use in public mourning.</p>
            <p>There are psalms scattered throughout scripture. The one considered to be the oldest is the Song of Miriam recorded in Ex. 15:20-21 to celebrate the salvation of the Hebrews after the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea. In Moses’ longer song (15:1-18), he begins with Miriam’s couplet and goes on the describe their deliverance. The prophet Isaiah uses songs to get his message across, and there is the Song of Solomon which contains love poems that we understand as between God and the people of God. In the New Testament in the first chapter of the gospel of Luke, we are familiar with Mary’s “Magnificat” and Zechariah’s hymn at the circumcision of his son we know as John the Baptist. The epistles also give us several early Christian hymns.</p>
            <p>Biblical psalms generally speak of God’s action and people’s response. You may want to try your hand at composing one today. Think of a time when you recognized God working in your life, in the world around you. Put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard, and let your thoughts flow. You may be surprised at what comes forth. Address your words to the Holy One, and express your feelings, no matter if they are positive or negative. You can trust, as our psalmist affirms: “The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end.”</p>
