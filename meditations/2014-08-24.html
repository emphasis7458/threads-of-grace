            <p>In our epistle lesson Paul says, “ . . . we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members of one another.” He was speaking of the Christian community of his day, but perhaps he said more than he knew. Our picture of the world, of the cosmos has grown and changed in the last 2000 years. Thanks to the world’s scientists, mystics, and theologians, we have come to recognize the interdependence of all creation—that it is all one body flowing from the Divine Creator in Love. We look at the picture of what appears to be a precious blue marble swirling through space, what we call “this fragile earth our island home,” and we can’t help but know that we are bound together in this one body. We’ve come to accept the concept of “the butterfly effect” that posits a butterfly flapping its wings in search of nectar in Apalachicola could cause a tornado half the world away; yet we’re slow to realize that what each of us thinks or says or does impacts not just those around us, but all of this one body of which we are a part. Our choices for good or ill make a difference to creation in ways we can’t imagine. Remember the old proverbial rhyme: “For want of a nail a shoe was lost.”? “For want of a nail a shoe was lost. For want of a shoe a horse was lost. For want of a horse a rider was lost. For want of a rider a message was lost. For want of a message a battle was lost. For want of a battle a kingdom was lost. And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.” Today, it likely isn’t a horseshoe nail that makes the difference, but what we do or don’t do in every arena of our lives. If we entrust ourselves to God, the Holy One will use us to incarnate Love here and now, to bless this one body of creation.</p>
