            <p>From the time we were children, when we bumped up against interpersonal conflict, we have heard those in authority recommend what we have come to call the Golden Rule. Luke’s version in our gospel for All Saints’ Day (Nov.1) that we celebrate today says: “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” That is how we live out Jesus’ commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves, to love one another as Christ Jesus loves us.</p>
            <p>As if that weren’t clear enough for us, Luke gives us some specifics: “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.” Hearing that, we tend to respond with something like: “Yeah, but that’s not fair. I have a right to defend myself,” and go on our merry self-centered way causing conflict to escalate between us and them. And if that divine message weren’t outrageous enough, Jesus goes on with specific actions we need to take in certain circumstances: “If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. Give to anyone who begs from you, and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again.” If we are honest, our response is likely to be in the nature of: “Surely we aren’t expected to take that literally today. Those were circumstances common in Jesus’ day. No one could live like that now.” Actually people can and people do.</p>
            <p>All around the world, in every culture everywhere, we find versions of the Golden Rule recommended as the standard for living in community with one another. It is the way of agape love, the generous self-giving love that Jesus modeled for us in his life on earth, the way all the saints of all time have given of themselves for the love of God. It is so simple: “Do to others as you would have them do to you,” and you can’t go wrong.</p>
