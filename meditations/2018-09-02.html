            <p>In today’s lesson from the Hebrew scriptures, we hear the Beloved call us to come away with him, letting go of all the things that distract us from Divine Love so that we can focus on deepening our relationship with God and thence others. Basil Pennington, in the introduction to his book The Song of Songs: A Spiritual Commentary, points out: “You are the Beloved of the Divine Lover. You are loved with a love beyond that which human words can express, which song and pen seek in some way to convey or at least hint at. Let go. Let the currents of Love invade you. Let your deepest soul rejoice as it is drawn forth into the ecstasy of love.” What a powerful and soul-stirring statement that is! How can we begin to respond to such an invitation?</p>
            <p>In Mathew 6:6, Jesus tells us to “ . . . go into your room (closet, KJV) and shut the door and pray,” that is, open ourselves to God’s indwelling, enfolding Presence, settle down and pay attention to the Source and Essence of all. We merely need to be, entrusting the experience to the Beloved who knows just what we need here and now. When we center down into the deep of our own being, no matter who or where we are, it is the Divine Presence we encounter there.</p>
            <p>The Beloved indicates that now is the time; there is no need to delay. All is in readiness as the outside reflects the inner climate. Day by day, may we “Let go. Let the currents of Love invade [us.]”</p>
