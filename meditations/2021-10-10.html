<div class="meditation-content">
<p>The writer to the Hebrews tells us that we are "laid bare" before God. That is what we acknowledge every time we make Eucharist in our prayer: "Almighty God, to you all hearts are open, all desires known, and from you no secrets are hid: cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of your Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love you, and worthily magnify your holy Name; through Christ our Lord. Amen."</p>
<p>We don't like the thought of being "laid bare", of being so vulnerable, of letting go of all the protective armor we've garnered over the years to shield are self-centered ego-self. Yet, if we want to deepen our relationship with the Beloved, that's just what we are called to do--surrender ourselves into God's hands--Mary's "yes" to the Angel Gabriel is our model.</p>
<p>When I came to realize I had to give up my control over everything in order to move forward, I was inspired by all the prayers of surrender I came across in my spiritual reading. I offer the following surrender prayer from Charles de Foucauld, an early 20th century French priest and hermit in the Sahara Desert in Algeria. May it enable you to lay yourself bare before the Holy One.</p>
<p>"Father,</p>
<p>I abandon myself into your hands,</p>
<p>do with me what you will.</p>
<p>Whatever you may do, I thank you:</p>
<p>I am ready for all, I accept all.</p>
<p>Let only your will be done in me,</p>
<p>and in all your creatures.</p>
<p>I wish no more than this, O Lord.</p>
<p>Into your hands. I commend my soul:</p>
<p>I offer it to you with all the love of my heart,</p>
<p>for I love you, Lord, and so need to give myself,</p>
<p>to surrender myself into your hands without reserve,</p>
<p>and with boundless confidence,</p>
<p>for you are my Father."</p>
