<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Palm Sunday, Year A • Lent</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Isaiah 50:4-9a, Psalm 31:9-16, Philippians 2:5-11, Matthew 26:14—27:66</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Scripture tells us that, after Jesus’ crucifixion and burial, the chief priests and Pharisees “went with the guard and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone,” or so they thought. From this side of Easter, we know the rest of the story. Jesus’ resurrection illustrates that there is nothing we can do to thwart God’s desire to bring new life out of death, however it may appear. Even Job knew that long before the first Easter. (Job 42:2)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If we are honest, we have to admit that we’ve wasted a lot of time in our lives trying to seal the stone covering the entrance to our hardened hearts. Whenever we feel the least bit vulnerable, we marshall our defenses: denial, projection of shame/blame onto others, betrayal, lying, fight or flight, anything to avoid the daily deaths that come our way. At some point we will be blessed to realize that none of our machinations help, that sealing the stone simply doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">As we are filled with compunction, cracks begin to show up in our stony, self-centered hearts, and we come to recognize the Beloved at work in our lives. As Nan Merrill puts it in her Psalms for Praying (97:8-9): “Heaven delights and rejoices when a hardened heart breaks open and recognizes Love’s ever-patient Presence abiding with in. For You, O Beloved . . . overlook our wrongdoings and welcome us home.” As we walk with Jesus this Passion Week, may we be aware of Love’s ever-patient Presence bringing us to new life day by day.</span></p>
