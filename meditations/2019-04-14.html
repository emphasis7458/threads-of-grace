<div class="meditation-content">
<p>Take time to read Luke’s passion gospel, Lk.22:14—23:56, in all its painful, agonizing detail, from the Passover meal through Jesus’ burial and the women’s sabbath rest. Imagine you are there witnessing the story as it happens; let yourself feel the emotions that rise up from your heart as each scene plays out before you. Join the women in resting as the passage closes.</p>
<p>Take a few deep, cleansing breaths and turn to the psalm appointed for today, Ps.31:9-16. Read it in the light of the gospel you have just experienced. Hear the words coming from Jesus himself as he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives. Imagine his despondency as he recognizes he feels “as useless as a broken pot.” But still he testifies, “I have trusted in you, O Lord, . . . you are my God. My times are in your hand; rescue me from the hand of my enemies . . . in your loving kindness save me.” There he is crying out just as we do in our distress here and now. Our gospel proclaims his self-giving love showing forth at the end of his prayer as he says, “yet not my will but yours be done.” What an affirmation of Jesus’ absolute trust in the Lord! And what an example for us as to how to accept what is right before us in the circumstances of our lives.</p>
<p>Our times are in God’s hands who is at work in us, transforming us into the imago dei we were created to be.</p>
<p>Thanks be to God!</p>
