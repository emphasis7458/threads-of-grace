<p>As God called Abraham to an unimaginable walk with the Holy One, so God calls us, each and all, to face each day as it comes, trusting in Divine Love to see us through whatever it may bring. Would that our ears would be open to hear the Beloved call us each by name and that we would respond with Abraham, "Here I am," ready and willing to Incarnate God's love in the world here and now.</p>
<p>In this time of uncertainty, the very air can seem filled with fear and anxiety, raising unanswerable questions of what, when, how will the future be manifest. Worrying won't make life any easier; in so doing we simply violate our peace. It is in times like these that we learn to be patient, taking one day at a time, accepting what is with grace and peace. Relying on Mary's example of "Here I am, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word," (Lk.1:28) we can be confident that when we respond in like manner, God will use us to be God's loving presence wherever we are, whatever we do. It is helpful for us to reach out to others who may be in the same boat, calling or texting on the phone, sending notes, "zooming" on the computer. We can trust the Beloved to use this time for our benefit and for the benefit of the whole world somehow, in ways we can't yet begin to imagine.</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream in which I am walking along the beach going eastward. I feel a Presence walking along side of me on my left. I don't see who it is, but I know someone is with me. I am not alone. I come to a muddy river and see it is roiling up in a circle near the shore. I realize that it is a natural spring bubbling up through the river water. I feel encouraged to step into the water to go to the other side. When I do, I feel my feet on something like a natural roadway underwater. In my dream I think it will be the foundation for a bridge that will be built in the future. When I awoke, I realized that, for me, it was an affirmation of hope that "All shall be well" as Julian of Norwich proclaimed in an even more uncertain time.</p>
