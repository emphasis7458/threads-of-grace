        <div class="meditation-content">
            <p>The epistle lesson for today reminds us that we abide in Christ as he abides in us. For me, "abiding" is such a grace-filled word, expressing presence, steadfastness, comfort, love. I can trust in the abiding presence of Christ Jesus and peacefully rest there.</p>
            <p>The Virgin of the Sign (Isaiah 7:14) icon shown here, which I have mentioned previously in "Threads of Grace", speaks to me of abiding. The icon shows Mary standing with her hands raised in the orans praying position. At the center of her heart is a heavenly sphere containing the image of Christ Immanuel with his right hand lifted in blessing. The background is gold, representing, for me, the glory of God, the Holy Presence, the Shekinah. This icon sits beside my prayer chair, and I see me in the image of Mary. As I focus my attention on the icon, it encourages my contemplation of the reality of Christ Jesus abiding deep within my heart and my abiding in the enfolding presence of the Divine. Perhaps it will for you too.</p>
            <p>Knowing that God's steadfast love and mercy indwells and enfolds me day by day enables me to trust that Everything Belongs (Richard Rohr) and makes life a secure adventure, leaving no room for fear or anxiety. What precious grace! It's all about the Divine Presence. God's love will not let us go, neither here nor hereafter. Whether we are aware of it or not, we are, with the psalmist, dwelling in "the house of the Lord", now and forever.</p>
