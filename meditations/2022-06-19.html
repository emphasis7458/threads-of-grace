        <div class="meditation-content">
            <p>Years ago, when I had a more physically active ministry, I prepared a three-fold flyer describing what kinds of spiritual programs I could provide folks. The title was “Athirst for God”. It was based on this passage from Psalm 42 which we read today:</p>
            <p>“As a deer longs for the water-brooks,</p>
            <p>so longs my soul for you, O God.</p>
            <p>My soul is athirst for God, athirst for the living God.”</p>
            <p>On the cover was a picture of a deer family (stag, doe, fawn) standing just outside a forest on the edge of a stream in early dawn light--or perhaps at dusk. The stag was alert; the doe drinking her fill; the fawn investigating the grass at the edge of the water--a precious memory of my offerings of drinks of cold water to thirsty pilgrims.</p>
            <p>I was athirst for God and delighted to share with others practices that helped assuage my thirst. It was a full and rich time in my life with abounding opportunities to serve others “athirst for God”. I found that the more I offered myself to others, the thirstier I became, the more I needed to be filled with this living water of the Divine. With God, there is always more—more to give, more to receive; Jesus said, “I came that they might have life and have it abundantly.” (Jn.10:19) That abundance is God's desire for each of us.</p>
            <p>When we venture out to take a sip of what is offered, the Beloved recognizes our thirst, our readiness for more, and the Holy One responds with a cupful. When we consume the cup and remain thirsty, a bucketful is provided. And so it goes in our mutual giving and receiving relationship, ever growing more deeply into love with God and with our neighbor. As our collect for today puts it: “you [God] never fail to help and govern those whom you have set upon the sure foundation of your loving kindness.”</p>
