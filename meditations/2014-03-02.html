    <title>When Jesus lived on earth, he could physically touch those in need of his healing presence. His presence, his touch is a real today as it was 2000 years ago, although we experience it in different ways. Whenever we experience confusion and fear: when the doctor says surgery is called for, when we face life following the loss of a loved one, when our child is late coming home, when we don’t see how the bills can be paid, when we don’t see how we can make it through the day—through another minute, even—Christ Jesus reaches out and touches us. | Threads of Grace</title>

            <p>Sometimes the touch comes as a feeling of unexplainable peace when we are struggling to go back to sleep at 2:00 a.m. Sometimes it is a warm glow that seems to surround us in the midst of the chaos of our lives. Sometimes it’s the note or phone call from a friend. Sometimes it is the realization that we are not alone, that others have been right where we are and survived, even thrived, thereafter.</p>
            <p>When we have experienced Christ Jesus’ touch in the dark times of our lives and felt his perfect love casting out all our fear, we are called to reach out to those around us who are in need of the compassionate touch of the Divine, to incarnate God’s love to them through the power of Christ Jesus’ healing presence dwelling in our hearts.</p>
