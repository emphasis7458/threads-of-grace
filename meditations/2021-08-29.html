<p>Take some time to read today's lesson from the Hebrew scriptures slowly, maybe even reading it more than once. Let it soak in, accepting our tradition that considers this book as a love song between God and God's people, both individually and collectively. Can you hear the Beloved calling your name, inviting you to spend time with the Holy One? It is the same invitation we hear from Jesus: "Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest awhile." (Mark 6: 31) The invitation is real here and now.</p>
<p>God wants us to come to know that we are loved far beyond what words can express. When we are so absorbed in the day-to-day, consumed by the minutiae of life, we seldom notice the call. Perhaps that's why Jesus' invitation is expanded to show us the way: a deserted place, alone, resting awhile. As we rest in God's enfolding presence, opening ourselves up to the unfolding revelation of divine Love, with the intention of letting go of all that separates us from the Beloved, the ears of our hearts are opened to hear and respond to that love song.</p>
<p>It helps to have some kind of daily practice that draws you into God's presence, whatever quiets you in body, mind, and heart. It doesn't matter what form your practice takes: meditation, contemplation, any prayer of quiet, Centering Prayer, walking meditation, chosen solitude, etc., so long as you are willing to make it part of your life, making room for the Beloved in your breathing in and your breathing out as part of your experience.</p>
