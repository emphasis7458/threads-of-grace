        <div class="meditation-content">
            <p>Before St. Francis was recognized as a saint, he struggled with knowing God’s will for his life, just as we often do. One day, along with two of his close friends, he opened the scriptures to find the answer. He touched the page that happened to contain our epistle passage for today, and his fingers lighted on the words: “follow in his steps.” His eyes and heart were opened to recognize that as God’s call for his life and set about living into it.</p>
            <p>It is our call as well. That is the point of the shepherd parable in today’s gospel. “When [the shepherd] has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.” Knowing his voice is the key. It is easy for us to be led astray by the culture of the world, the siren call of fame and fortune, of power and prestige. The comfort of the status quo can be equally alluring. We’re not vulnerable, there’s no risk if we stay right where we are and don’t venture out into the unknown.</p>
            <p>Once we hear Christ Jesus call our name, once our ears are attuned to the voice of God however it may come to us, our hearts are open in anticipation of where it might lead. It might be to green pastures and still waters; it might be through the valley of the shadow of death, but through it all we can trust the presence of God to be with us providing whatever we may need for the journey. The footsteps of Christ are countercultural. Francis found that to be true in his day; it remains true today. Humility, self-giving, welcoming the marginalized, making time to be with God, all marks of Jesus’ way, are not highly regarded in the world around us. It takes courage and commitment and especially love to follow in his steps.</p>
