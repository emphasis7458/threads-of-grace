<p>In our lesson from the Acts of the Apostles, we hear the deacon Stephen, who is about to be martyred, proclaim, “Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” I’d be very surprised to hear that any of you have had that particular experience, but you never know. God knows us inside out, knows what touches our heart and what distractions keep us blinded to the hand of God at work in our lives. The Holy One meets us where we are, regardless of the circumstances and situations of our lives, and as we are, physically, emotionally, spiritually.</p>
<p>Each encounter is unique, designed to be just what we need or are ready for at the time, to draw us deeper into relationship with God. The Beloved can and does use all our senses to reach us. It could be a vision such as Stephen’s or a warming of the heart as John Wesley described is experience of the Divine. Some folks recognize the presence of God in some aspect of creation, animal, vegetable or mineral. Others may more likely experience the encounter in a worship service, or walking a labyrinth, or sitting in silence. Some may hear the Word of the Lord through their ears—others through their heart--others out of the mouths of friends or strangers—and others on the pages of their journals. Some may be touched by a sweet fragrance that gets their attention, and still others may feel the arm of God encircling them and drawing them near. There is no limit to Divine Initiative.</p>
<p>If we are open and alert, expectant and available, our eyes will more easily be opened when we hear the call to LOOK. With the Holy One, there is always more to experience.</p>
