<p>“I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?” Take time to read that sentence from the prophet Isaiah again, s l o w l y. And now again. Sit with it, and let yourself become aware of the new thing God is doing in your life right now. The very breath you are taking is new. You have never breathed this breath before. Every inhalation, every exhalation is new. Rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
<p>Something new is our Creator’s way. From the beginning, we have discovered one new thing after another coming into the world, and God proclaims it good. Look at the world around you; the burgeoning Spring is visible in every direction. A few short weeks ago, we were surrounded by barren trees that now are sprouting new green growth. Flowers abound as do the lush dandelions and wild strawberry plants in my yard. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
<p>Remember: “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away, behold the new has come.” (II Cor.5:17) Martin L. Smith in his book of Lenten daily meditations entitled A Season for the Spirit, p.81, says, “. . . when I stop insisting on what I am and loosen my grip on what I have been, but continually open myself in prayer to what God is inviting me to become and recognize that I can be born again—and again and again. I am still malleable, new buds appear, new gifts can be bestowed. My mind can change, new horizons open up.” May we all rejoice and be glad in the new thing God is doing in our lives.</p>
