<div class="meditation-content">
<p>In our first lesson today, the apostles' question of Christ Jesus reminds me of the perennial questions of children on family road trips: "Are we there yet? When will we get there? How much longer will it be?" I suspect we might all be able to relate to that anticipation in today's uncertain times.</p>
<p>In the most important journey we ever make, I suggest to you that the time is Now. It is in the NOW that we encounter the Holy One. In this present moment, the Divine Presence is indwelling us, enfolding us, whether we are aware of it or not. It is why Brother Lawrence, a Cistercian lay brother in the 17th century, encouraged us to "Practice the Presence", that is, to hold the Beloved in one's heart and do everything with love. Wherever we are NOW, we just let ourselves be there, gently accepting the awareness that is awakening from deep within. As we practice, our awareness of the Presence grows much like that of the mustard seed in Jesus' parable (Mark 4:31 ff). Whatever we are doing as we go about our ordinary daily lives, NOW is the time to open our hearts to God, to welcome the flower of pure love that the Holy One is unfolding in us NOW.</p>
<p>Here's another way of putting it:</p>
<p>"You do not have to Look for anything, just Look.</p>
<p>You do not have to Listen for specific Sounds, just Listen.</p>
<p>You do not have to Accomplish anything, just Be.</p>
<p>And in the Looking, and in the Listening, and in the Being, find Me."</p>
<p>Ann Lewin (quoted by Esther de Waal in Lost in Wonder)</p>
<p>Yes, NOW is the time to open our hearts and minds to God, to one another, to Love.</p>
