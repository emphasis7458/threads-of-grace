            <p>The apostle Paul used the phrase, "in Christ", many times in his letters to try to explain our relationship with and to the Holy One. As I hear these words today, I am reminded of the understanding described by the quantum physicist, David Bohm. In his description from the perspective of his physics knowledge and experience, he viewed all creation, the entire cosmos, enveloped in the presence of God which he called the Implicate Order. He envisioned the Holy One enfolding all in oneness, what we might recognize as the One "in whom we live and move and have our being". (Acts 17: 28) For me, that sounds like being in the womb of God. In what he calls the Explicate Order, Bohm sees all growing and expanding from the inside out, from the spark of the Divine that is the center of each and all. That speaks to me of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Bear in mind this is my spiritual understanding of Bohm's technical writing; no doubt he is turning over in his grave right now at my brief description of his work.</p>
            <p>Bohm's presentation opened my eyes to see how God uses everything and anything to manifest the Divine Presence in the world and beyond, how nothing is off limits or out of bounds when it comes to stretching our imagination to get a grasp on Reality in its fullness. The revolving flow inward and outward keeps us in balance, in harmony, ready to Incarnate Love in our time and space.</p>
            <p>Try sitting with the phrase, "in Christ", for a while and notice how you feel. Can you begin to relate to Bohm's Implicate Order embracing you in Love? Then, perhaps sometime later, center yourself with Bohm's Explicate Order where the Holy One moves you to grow in grace, to be transformed into the imago dei you were created to be. You may want to journal with your experience of being "in Christ".</p>
