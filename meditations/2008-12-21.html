            <p>The good news is that YOU have found favor with God! That is Paul’s “mystery that was kept secret for long ages but is now disclosed.” We have found such favor that the Lord has come to dwell among us, to incarnate his love in us, to give us peace, rest from our enemies, without and within. He came physically to be with us 2000 years ago, and he comes to be with us today through his Holy Spirit, through his body and blood in Eucharist.</p>
            <p>Certainly, we don’t deserve his favor. In the busyness of our lives, we close our ears to his word. We ignore his call. We have not prepared a place for him in our hearts. We have done those things which we ought not to have done, and we have left undone those things which we ought to have done. There is, indeed, no health in us. His favor is pure grace—a gift of his steadfast love.</p>
            <p>Like Mary in this week’s gospel, we are perplexed. How can it possibly be that we have found favor with God? How can the Holy Spirit come upon us? How does he abide with us? How can our barrenness become fruitful? How can our rebelliousness be transformed into faithful obedience?</p>
            <p>The answer is found in Mary’s example, in her acceptance of God’s radical grace. The Lord waits for us to open ourselves to receive the gifts he has prepared for us. They have our names on them, just as the wrapped packages waiting under our Christmas trees. When we can join Mary in responding, “Let it be with me according to your word,” we find the “power of the Most High” does visit us and enables us to walk in the path of the Incarnate One. As we pray Mary’s prayer of surrender each day, we will come to recognize that, as our collect says, a mansion, designed by the Divine Architect, is being prepared in our hearts as the perfect dwelling place for his love.</p>
