            <p>“I will not keep silent,” the Hebrew prophet Isaiah announces. Experiencing the glorious salvation of God, he could not keep the good news quiet. Neither could the psalmist, nor the apostle Paul, nor John the forerunner, nor John the gospeler in today’s lessons. And neither can we!</p>
            <p>Whenever we open ourselves to God unreservedly and allow the Word of God to be born in the manger of our hearts, the Light of God to be enkindled in our souls, we find that we are inspired to share our experience with others. At first, we may feel hesitant to speak of the ways we see God at work in our lives, afraid others will not be a receptive audience, anxious that they might even be hostile, challenging our message. No matter how vulnerable we may feel, we can take heart at God’s message to Paul: “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent; for I am with you.” (Acts 18:9) We can trust God to bring to us those who can benefit from our testimony when we have the courage to not keep silent.</p>
            <p>Sharing the love of God with others, however, doesn’t always require words—remember St. Francis’ dictum: “Preach the gospel; use words if you must.” That’s just another way of saying “Actions speak louder than words.” When we welcome and accept the transforming presence of God dwelling within, we begin to notice that we are changing—and others notice it, as well. The Light of God will shine forth in and through our lives—some days more brightly than others, needless to say. Cleansing, healing, transformation is seldom instantaneous. It may take some time for God’s sanctifying presence to bring us to wholeness and holiness, to the imago dei we were created to be.</p>
            <p>During these twelve days of the Christmas season, it can be our joy to let the new light burning in our hearts spring forth in love.</p>
