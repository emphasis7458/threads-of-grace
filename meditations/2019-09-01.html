        <div class="meditation-content">
            <p>The prophet Jeremiah in the sixth century before the Common Era cautioned the house of Israel that the Lord was not happy with their response to God’s faithfulness. He pointed out that not only all the ordinary people, but the rulers, priest, and prophets as well “went after worthless things . . . went after things that do not profit.” All these hundreds of years later and we haven’t learned much. If our hearts are open, we can hear Jeremiah’s voice saying we are the ones who still go after things that do not profit our relationship with God.</p>
            <p>Take some time and think of some things that you spend time doing that you know do not profit you physically, mentally, or spiritually. You might even want to make a list. Reflect on each one and determine if you need to give it up or modify it in some way; for example, spending less time checking social media, or playing electronic games, or as a couch potato in front of the TV. Perhaps you’ll discover that your priorities are skewed, that you focus more on getting ahead than on relationships, that power, prestige, fortune matter more to you than loving God and neighbor. If your heart is convicted by what you find, it is never too late to change the direction of your life. God ever stands ready to help you make the next step on the way.</p>
            <p>On the day I started reflecting on Jeremiah’s words, I read from Nan Merrill’s Psalms for Praying, Ps.123, p.271. Her last two verses seem to be the perfect prayer for us as we amend out hearts and minds:</p>
            <p>“Have mercy, O Compassionate One, have mercy.</p>
            <p>that we might turn from our blind and ignorant ways.</p>
            <p>Too long our souls have been veiled by fear;</p>
            <p>have mercy, lead us to the path of wholeness.” Amen.</p>
