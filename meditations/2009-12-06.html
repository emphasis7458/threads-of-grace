            <p>We might call the second Sunday of Advent “Prophet Sunday” because our collect, the canticle from Zechariah, and our gospel lesson all relate to the role of prophets. We become aware of prophets in our midst when we hear the voice of God coming to us from such notables as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., but others nearby may be called to serve as God’s prophets from time to time. Those we may recognize by the role they play in our lives.</p>
            <p>Prophets are folks who come to disturb our peace. Prophets rock the boat. Prophets shake us up. Prophets let us know in no uncertain terms that the status quo will not do. Prophets awaken us with awkward questions. Prophets open our eyes to the reality of the world so that our hearts can begin to see where we are going astray. Prophets call us to take a good look at ourselves, at our self-centeredness, in comparison to God’s self-emptying, self-giving for us. Prophets challenge us to repent, to change, to be what God has created us to be.</p>
            <p>Prophets come to us, not only with warning and exhortation, but with encouragement. Prophets bring us hope in the midst of despair. Prophets comfort and console us when we are overwhelmed with grief. Prophets nurture us when we are discouraged. Prophets intercede for us when we can’t pray for ourselves. Prophets hold us in their compassionate hearts. By one way or another, prophets lead us ever closer to God.</p>
            <p>God sends his messengers, the prophets, to each of us with the particular message we need to hear at the time. Think about those who have been prophets for you—who have filled the valleys, lowered the hills, made the crooked straight, smoothed the rough places, and opened your eyes to see the salvation of God—and be thankful that God continues to come to us in his prophets “to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</p>
