            <p>Three times in our gospel passage Jesus exhorts his disciples to “have no fear,” “do not fear,” “do not be afraid.” While he makes it clear that discipleship is not a walk in the park, Jesus encourages trust in the steadfast love of the Father, who has his eye on the smallest sparrow, and who has counted the hairs on our heads, to see us through whatever difficulties that following Christ may bring into our lives.</p>
            <p>C.D. Martin, the gospel lyricist, has captured the spirit of Christ’s message for me in the hymn, “God Will Take Care of You:” Be not dismayed whate’er betide, God will take care of you; Beneath His wings of love abide, God will take care of you. God will take care of you, Thro’ every day, O’er all the way; God will take care of you, God will take care of you.</p>
            <p>Thro’ days of toil when heart doth fail, God will take care of you; When dangers fierce your path assail, God will take care of you.</p>
            <p>All you may need He will provide, God will take care of you; Nothing you ask will be denied, God will take care of you.</p>
            <p>No matter what may be the test, God will take care of you; Lean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you.</p>
            <p>When we can come to accept that promise and trust that truth, fear will be released from our minds and hearts. It is virtually impossible for fear and trust to exist in us simultaneously. Either fear will dissipate trust, or trust will overcome our fear.</p>
            <p>God will take care of you; have no fear!</p>
