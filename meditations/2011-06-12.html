            <p>Heavenly fire is different from earthly fire. Earthly fire destroys, while heavenly fire creates and inspires new life. Throughout salvation history we find heavenly fire being used to reach out to God’s people in love.</p>
            <p>God used a smoking firepot and a flaming torch to ratify his covenant with Abraham (Gen.15:1-21). God called to Moses in a flame of fire out of a burning bush that was not consumed by the flames (Ex.3:1-6). The Israelites were led through the wilderness by a pillar of fire by night (Ex. 13:21-22), and God spoke to the children of Israel out of the blazing mountain at Horeb/Sinai (Ex. 19:16-20). Heavenly fire consumed Elijah’s sacrifice in his contest with the prophets of Baal (I Kgs.18:20-39) and Solomon’s when his magnificent temple was dedicated (I Kgs.8:62-64). A chariot and horses of fire in a whirlwind carried Elijah into heaven at the end of his life (II Kgs.2:9-12). Shadrach, Meshak, and Abednigo were thrown into earthly fire but were saved by heavenly fire (Dan.3:13-30). And finally, John the baptizer announced the coming of the One who would baptize not with water but with the Holy Spirit and with heavenly fire (Mk. 1:4-8).</p>
            <p>That is what we celebrate on Pentecost—God’s heavenly fire empowering the apostles to go and proclaim Christ’s message of love and redemption, what we sometimes call the birthday of the Church. Closing the canon of scripture did not quench the heavenly fire. It is active in Trinity Church, and it is available to each one of us as we are open to receive it. As we allow God to breathe in and through us, we are inspired to love and serve others. We experience the heavenly fire consuming our hearts with zeal, with joy and delight, with God’s peace.</p>
