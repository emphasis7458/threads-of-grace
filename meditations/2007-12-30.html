            <p>“When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son…” In the fullness of time, when God’s people were ready, God sent his Son into the world to redeem the world, “yet the world did not know him.” In the fullness of time, “when the days were accomplished,” (Lk.2:6 KJV) God sent his Son to us through Mary who “laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.” (Lk.2:7 KJV) In the fullness of time, God sent his Son “to bring good news to the poor,…to proclaim release to the captive and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor,” (Lk.4:18-19) as foretold by the prophet Isaiah (Is.62:1-2). In the fullness of time, God sent his Son to be the Light of the World, “to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.”(Lk.1:79) In the fullness of time, God sent his Son to nurture us into the way of Love, to be the Bread of Life so that “whoever comes to [him] will never be hungry, and whoever believes in [him] will never be thirsty.” (Jn.6:35). In the fullness of time, God sent his Son to be the Good Shepherd, who searches for us when we are lost and rejoices when we are found. In the fullness of time, God sent his Son to enable us to be children of God, “and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.” (Roms.8:17)</p>
            <p>In the fullness of time, God sends his Son to each of us, to nestle into the manger of our hearts, when our hearts are ready, when we are open to receive, when we recognize our need for God’s Love in our lives.</p>
            <p>And in the fullness of time, when the world is at last ready for him, Christ will come again!</p>
            <p>Thanks be to God!</p>
