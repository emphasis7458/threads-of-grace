<p>Thomas was not with the other disciples when Christ Jesus appeared to them on the evening of the day of Resurrection. We don’t know where he was; scripture doesn’t tell us. Perhaps he was suffering from “survivor’s guilt.” After all, when Lazarus died and Jesus prepared to journey to Bethany, it was Thomas who said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” (Jn.11:14-16) Perhaps he was “sitting shiva” with Jesus’ family for the traditional Jewish mourning period. Perhaps he was checking to see that Jesus’ mother Mary and Mary Magdalene had everything they needed. Perhaps he just needed to grieve alone. What we do know is that when Thomas was ready, he came back to be with the other disciples, and Christ Jesus came to Thomas to love him back into the community. God in Christ Jesus met Thomas where he was and opened his eyes to see the Risen Lord.</p>
<p>God continually meets us, each and all, just where we are in all the messes of our lives, in our darkness, in our pain and distress, whenever we feel failure, loss, and death. God comes with the power of Christ Jesus’ resurrection in whatever way we may need it. The Holy One, the One to “whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid,” knows whereof we are made and just where new life is needed. If, like Thomas, we need to see Christ’s wounds, that is how the Divine Presence is manifested. If we need the comfort of an embrace, it comes. If we need light, light comes to show the way before us one step at a time. If we need peace, it comes from deep within. If we need strength and courage, somehow they will well up to enable us to handle whatever we face.</p>
<p>New life comes out of the death of the old, like the phoenix rising from the ashes. We know we have to go through the confusion and complexity of Good Friday to get to the joy of Easter, trusting that God meets us where we are. If only we could always be ready to receive the new life of resurrection, the power of resurrection to uphold us day by day, the Divine Love for us expressed in the Resurrection encouraging us henceforth to walk hand in hand with the Beloved.</p>
