            <p>In the epistle passage from Romans appointed for today, Paul speaks of the newness of life that comes from our being united with Christ Jesus, “dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” in a completely new way. After having his Damascus road conversion experience, Paul knew just how radical the newness of life in God’s grace could be.</p>
            <p>The collect for today acknowledges the “sure foundation of [God’s] loving-kindness,” that is the foundation of newness of life in Christ. Sadly, loving-kindness is in short supply in our culture today. Civil discourse has become uncivil—rude, crude, ugly, hate filled. Unfortunately, it seems to be catching. Because we are so surrounded by incivility in the 24/7 media, it seems normal, O.K. Appropriate behavior and courteous conversation have taken a backseat to venting our spleens wherever we are, on whatever subject catches our attention, to whomever will listen to our ranting and raving. It’s not surprising to see that such lack of self-control carries over into our communities, our churches, our homes.</p>
            <p>Consider how different the world would be if we, each and all, accepted the newness of life God has prepared for us in Christ Jesus. If we lived out of God’s loving-kindness day by day, what would be different in our lives? Would we find others responding with loving-kindness? Could that be as catching as the current negativeness seems to be? We’ll never know if we don’t choose to “walk in newness of life,” to take up the cross of loving-kindness, whatever the cost may be.</p>
