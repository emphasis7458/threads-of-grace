<p>We are marked with the sign of the cross at our baptism, marked as Christ’s own right from the start. While we may not realize it at the time, that sign indicates there will be a cross in our future as we allow ourselves to be transformed into the imago dei, into the image of God we were created to be. Each of our crosses will be unique, fashioned in love, designed to lead us on our journey home to God. We won’t have to search for our particular cross; it will face us when we are ready to pick it up.</p>
<p>The cross of Christ was made of two strong beams, one vertical, one horizontal. The cross with our name on it will be made the same way. The vertical beam, planted firmly in the earth, grounds us in reality and lifts our eyes to God. The horizontal beam stretches our arms wide to embrace the needs of those around us, the needs of the world near and far, for our self-giving love. Following Jesus, taking up our cross day by day, isn’t always easy, just ask the Mother Teresas, the Martin Luther Kings, the Gandhis, that whole cloud of witnesses (Heb.12:1) who have taken up the cross before us—but it is life-saving for us and for others. If, however, we need someone to help us on the way, to lighten the load, we can trust that a Simon of Cyrene will show up to encourage our hearts, to support us in love. God provides just what we need, when we need it, whether we recognize it or not.</p>
<p>At the center of the cross, where the vertical and horizontal beams meet, is Love. There we find the presence of God, always calling, always reaching out, always waiting for our response. When our cross comes before us, may we lift it gladly, going forward in joy, trusting in the path of self-giving love set before us.</p>
