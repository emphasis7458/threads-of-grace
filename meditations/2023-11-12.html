<p>It is important for us to be ready for our encounter with the Holy One whenever, however it may come. That is the message of the parable in our gospel for today. It would be easy to be prepared if we had an appointment, a specific day and time to expect God to show up in our lives. Jesus tells us in the previous chapter of Matthew’s gospel, however, that the Divine comes as unexpectedly as a thief in the night (Mt. 24:43). What if today is the day God will knock on your door? Are you ready?</p>
<p>We might learn what it takes to be ready for the encounter from the story of the Annunciation, of the angel Gabriel’s visit to Mary (Lk.1:26-38). For her, it was just a day like any other day. She was going about her ordinary tasks, preparing for her upcoming wedding to Joseph. But when she experienced the Divine Presence calling her name, she was alert to the call, awake to the holy moment, rather than being asleep at the switch as we might be. She was open to receive what God had prepared for her, available to be used in whatever way was needed. How often, on the other hand, do we, in our unreadiness, follow instead in Jonah’s path (Jon.1:3) and run in the opposite direction as fast as possible to avoid the potential confrontation? Once our hearts are open and we are ready to respond to God’s presence and transforming action in our lives, it is our joy to join Mary in consenting to serve the Lord with gladness. We delight in expressing in our own words what we call her “fiat”: “Here I am, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.”</p>
<p>There is an old story that says Gabriel had been going to and fro in Israel for some time encountering first one young woman and then another with an opportunity to serve God, but Mary was the first one to say yes. If we don’t want to miss our opportunity, we must be ready. “Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.” (Mt.24:42)</p>
