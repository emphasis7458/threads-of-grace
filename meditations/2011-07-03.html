            <p>“Come to me, all you that are weary and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.” That invitation has your name on it and mine. We are all “weary and carrying heavy burdens” from time to time. If not today, give thanks, but don’t be surprised when that falls your lot on another day. Whenever we find ourselves weighed down by the chances and changes of life, the situations that face us, the circumstances in which we find ourselves, we can take refuge in this gracious invitation. The Paraclete, the sustaining aspect of God, the One who walks beside us, is present to help us carry whatever our load might be, whether it is physical, emotional, mental, material, once we accept the invitation.</p>
            <p>The yoke is such lovely image of the care that our good and gracious God has for us, never leaving us to walk alone, to wander off the pathway that God has prepared for us. The One yoked with us lightens our load, balances the weight, keeps us from stumbling and falling under the stress and strain of whatever life sends our way.</p>
            <p>We, of course, always have the option of ignoring the invitation, or of saying, “No, I don’t need help. I want to do this my way,” or of thinking, “This is my cross, and I must suffer alone,” forgetting that Simon of Cyrene (Mt.27:32, Mk.15:21, Lk.23:16) was there for Jesus in his hour of need. What a waste of time and energy! We only increase our burden when we reject God’s mercy and steadfast love.</p>
            <p>“Rest for our souls”—what a precious promise—awaits us when we accept God’s invitation to come, when we accept the presence of the Holy One in our lives, trusting the Divine to go before us to make the rough places smooth, to bring us home at last into the perfect rest of abiding Love.</p>
