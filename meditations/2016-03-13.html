            <p>“I am about to do a new thing; now it springs forth; do you not perceive it?” God asks. Our Creator God is always doing a new thing. The Divine Economy is never static. Deep within and all around, the Holy One is at work in our lives, in the world, and throughout the cosmos.</p>
            <p>Once our eyes are opened to see God’s hand at work in our lives transforming us into the imago dei we were created to be, it is easier for us to recognize the Divine manifesting in other unlikely places all around us. It’s as if the veil is lifted from our perception, such that things that previously seemed, if not impossible, then improbable to say the least, are in fact true. God loves us, as we are, where we are. Nothing can separate us from God’s merciful, steadfast love. We are indwelt and enfolded in the Source and Essence of all.</p>
            <p>God calls us to cooperate in the Divine work of Love, to become co-creators with the Great Creator bringing peace and harmony into the world here and now. We can be God’s hands and feet and voice in the world when we respond to that call with Mary’s fiat: “Let it be with me according to your word.” When we can trust God absolutely and not be afraid to step out in faith into the unknown, the Beloved can and does use us to manifest Divine Love to others near and far. The new thing sprigs forth in the glory of God.</p>
