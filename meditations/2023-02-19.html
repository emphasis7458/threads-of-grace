            <p>Encounters with the Holy One evoke some kind of response from us. Often, like Peter on the Mount of Transfiguration, we want to do something to hold onto the experience. But no matter how hard we may try, the ephemeral disappears, and we are left with our analytical questions. What does it mean? What now? Do others have similar experiences? What kind of response is God calling forth from our hearts when we recognize we have been in the Presence of the Divine?</p>
            <p>Likely the first response will be awe and wonder, that may actually bring us to our knees, when we realize we have been surrounded and upheld by the glory of God for a time—as if we could ever be away from the One who is closer than our very breath. Gratefulness could rise up within us as we become aware of the hand of God at work in our lives, filling us with joy and delight despite the dismalness the day may bring. When we meet the Beloved in the onslaught of grief, the encounter can bring us comfort, strength to make it through the loss. Certainly, fear and trembling must be a common response to an encounter with God since, in scripture, we so often find the holy messenger calming the recipient with the words: “Do not be afraid.” On the other hand, we have the witness of John Wesley speaking of his heart being “strangely warmed” by his encounter with the holy. Think back to a time when your eyes were opened to be aware of the Divine Presence in your life, perhaps when your ears could hear the voice of God speaking directly to you, or when you felt embraced in the arms of Love or anointed with Grace. What was your initial response? How is your heart responding today as you reflect on your experience?</p>
            <p>I suspect the response that would most delight the Beloved is for us to be willing, like Moses, to enter the cloud of Presence and rest with Love for the proverbial forty days and forty nights. The forty days of Lent are fast approaching. Will you spend them with the Holy One?</p>
