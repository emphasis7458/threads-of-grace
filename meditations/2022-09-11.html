<p>As so often in the gospels, today we find that “the Pharisees and scribes were grumbling.” It seems to be human nature to grumble when things don’t go our way, when folks do things differently from our way or from our expectations. Grumbling frequently shows up when we feel the need to defend the status quo, when we fear the loss of control individually or collectively, when it appears there is someone or some group to blame. Anytime our boat is rocked, we tend to grumble. It is disconcerting to be faced with an unexpected change, and before we can even consider the implications of what the change might bring, we instantly react with grumbling, inside if not outside.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to reflect on the occasions of grumbling in your own life. What is the most common source of your particular grumbling? What red flags do you notice that set you off? Does your reflection enable you to begin to relate to the scribes and Pharisees in Jesus’ day?</p>
<p>What would life be like is we, each and all, could pause, take a breath before reacting to the stimuli whatever they might be, and give room for a grace-filled response to rise up from our hearts? What if we could accept what is, without judgment or fear, but rather with peace, kindness, gentleness, love? What if, as our collect prays for us, we would allow the Holy Spirit to direct and rule our hearts in all things so that we would become incarnations of God’s love in this place here and now? Grumbling or rejoicing—when the red flags appear, it is up to us.</p>
