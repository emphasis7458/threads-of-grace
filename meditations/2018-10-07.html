<p>The writer to the Hebrews tells us that Christ Jesus is “the exact imprint of God’s very being,” God’s Word through whom God created and sustains all things. Take time to ponder what implications that has for us. We know from the biblical creation story in Genesis that God said, “Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness.” (Gen.1:26a) That means we too carry the imprint of the Divine and that we, each and all, are intended to reflect God’s glory and to be good stewards of God’s creation.</p>
<p>Jesus came to show us the way to incarnate God’s love in the world, as an example of generous self-giving in contrast to the consuming self-centered culture of humankind that persists throughout history. All too often we lose sight of the divine imprint in ourselves, as well as others. Our imprint may blur and fade as a consequence of our choices in life, but is never completely erased. If we want to keep our imprint fresh and clear, we need to incline our heart, to pay attention to Jesus’ life. At his last supper with his disciples in response to a question from Thomas, Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” (Jn.14:6a)</p>
<p>The way Jesus walked through this life was one of prayer—from the 40-day retreat in the wilderness at the start of his public ministry to the garden of Gethsemane on the night of his betrayal, he went apart to spend time with God. His life was one of teaching, sharing the truth of God’s indwelling, enfolding Love, and healing, showing compassionate care to all who came is way and bringing forth new life to the glory of God who is the source and essence of all. May we walk in his ways day by day so that our imprint henceforth may glow with God’s Love.</p>
