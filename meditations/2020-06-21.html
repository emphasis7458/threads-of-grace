<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Third Sunday after Pentecost Proper 7, Year A • Ordinary Time</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Genesis 21:8-21, Psalm 86:1-10, 16-17, Romans 6:1b-11, Matthew 10:24-39</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Genesis 21:8-21, Psalm 86:1-10, 16-17, Romans 6:1b-11, Matthew 10:24-39</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the epistle passage from Romans appointed for today, Paul speaks of the newness of life that comes from our being united with Christ Jesus, “dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” in a completely new way. After having his Damascus road conversion experience, Paul knew just how radical the newness of life in God’s grace could be.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The collect for today acknowledges the “sure foundation of [God’s] loving-kindness,” that is the foundation of newness of life in Christ. Sadly, loving-kindness is in short supply in our culture today. Just look at "this tumultuous spring, with the country wracked by disease and economic ruin, and police violence and protests against systemic racism convulsing the nation from coast to coast." Jennifer Finney Boylan (quoted in a friend's blog) And that's not only in this country, but it's true around the world. Can anyone's heart fail to be convicted by the reality of the evils of domination and oppression that we see right before our eyes? What have we done with the sure foundation of God's loving kindness?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Consider how different the world would be if we, each and all, accepted the newness of life God has prepared for us in Christ Jesus. If we lived out of God’s loving-kindness day by day, what would be different in our lives? Would we find others responding with loving-kindness? We’ll never know if we don’t choose to “walk in newness of life,” to take up the cross of loving-kindness, whatever the cost may be.</span></p>
