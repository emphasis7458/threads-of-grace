            <p>Today is my mother’s 93rd birthday. As I read the scriptures appointed for this day, I can’t help but see them focused on her, on her life in Christ. From childhood, her ears have been attentive to the Word of God, as we hear of the people in Nehemiah’s day. With the psalmist, she would be the first to testify to the truth of the preciousness of the scriptures: “More to be desired than gold, more than much fine gold, sweeter far than honey, than honey in the comb. By them is your servant enlightened, and in keeping them is great reward.” How often in my childhood I remember her helping me learn my memory verse for Sunday school or longer passages that we were called to memorize, such as the 23rd Psalm, the Christmas story from Luke, the Easter story of the women going to the empty tomb, words that were inscribed in her heart.</p>
            <p>If she were looking over my shoulder as I read the epistle specifying many of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, she would vigorously deny that she had experienced a call from Christ, that she had ever proclaimed “the Good News of his salvation” (in the words of our collect). Considering St. Francis’ famous quote: “Preach the gospel; use words if you must,” however, I, and every one who knows her, would declare that she has been living into her call, proclaiming the Good News through her deeds of love her whole life long. She has been true to her call to be God’s hands and feet in her world, incarnating God’s love (the greater gift of which Paul speaks in the epistle) to all who come her way. Her whole life has been one of giving to others, listening, caring, affirming, nourishing, comforting, carrying, praying, peacemaking, supporting, freeing, being there whatever the need, whenever, wherever it arose.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of the Lord is and ever has been upon her, and God has anointed her with strength and courage, joy and delight, grace and peace, to be his presence to all he brings into her life. And she has responded faithfully every day of her life. Thanks be to God for her example of discipleship and her never-failing love!</p>
