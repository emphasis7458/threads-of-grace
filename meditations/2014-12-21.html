<p>The angel Gabriel told Mary of Nazareth that she had found favor with God. She must have been delighted to hear that message. Imagine knowing you’re on the right track, not having to wonder what God’s will is for your life. While initially that sounds like good news, I wonder what Mary thought about God’s favor as her story unfolded.</p>
<p>God’s favor meant she was an unwed mother-to-be, pregnant under mysterious and suspicious circumstances. God’s favor meant her baby was born in a stable in a crowded city far from home and family. God’s favor meant she and her husband and her baby had to flee into exile to avoid death. God’s favor meant her 12-year-old son stayed over in the temple in Jerusalem for three days instead of going home with her. God’s favor meant her son ignored his relatives to reach out to suffering humanity. God’s favor meant she had to watch her son die on a cross for being in God’s favor.</p>
<p>For Luke the Evangelist tells us “the favor of God was upon him,” (2:40) and “Jesus increased in...divine...favor,” (2:52) “and a voice came from heaven,...with you I am well pleased.” (3:22) The upshot of God’s favor in Jesus’ life was rejection in his home town, conflict with religious leaders, being misunderstood by those closest to him, betrayal, denial, scourging, and Golgotha. As Teresa of Avila said, “If this is how you treat your friends, it’s no wonder you have so few of them.”</p>
<p>But their story didn’t end on Golgotha. God’s favor to Mary, to Jesus, and to you and me is finally demonstrated in the empty tomb, the Resurrection with its promise of eternal life—in God’s favor.</p>
