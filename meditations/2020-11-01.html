<div class="meditation-content">

<p>I am always charmed by Lesbia Scott's hymn (Hymnal 1982, # 293) celebrating the saints of God and encouraging us to join the throng. There's not space to include the entire hymn , but you can look it up . Verse three follows:</p>
<p>"They lived not only in ages past, there are hundreds of thousands still,</p>
<p>The world is bright with the joyous saints who love to do Jesus' will.</p>
<p>You can meet them in schools, or in lanes, or at sea,</p>
<p>In church, or in trains, or in shops, or at tea,</p>
<p>For the saints of God are just folks like me, and I mean to be one too."</p>
<p>The first lesson appointed for All Saints' Day this year is from Revelation 7:9-17. Take some time right now to read this passage slowly, attentively. How does John's vision of the saints of God speak to you? To me, it seems to be peaceful, hopeful, assuring us of God's care forever, despite the turmoil of the world around us in the here and now.</p>
<p>In John's vision ". . . there was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands . . . the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of the water of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." We can join in the communion of saints with those who have gone before, who have passed through the great ordeal, as we accept our role as children of God and choose to follow Christ day by day. Are you ready?</p>
