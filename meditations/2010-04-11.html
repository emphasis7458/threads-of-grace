            <p>“. . . he breathed on them and said . . . ‘Receive the Holy Spirit.’ “ When God breathes on us today, we too receive the Holy Spirit infusing us with both peace and power, just as those first disciples were. As I sat with that phrase, with the picture of Christ Jesus breathing on them, on me, the hymn “Breathe on me, Breath of God” (Hymnal 1982, #508) came to mind and would not let me go. I opened the hymnal and read the verses, singing them in my head (where I am always in tune). Because that meditative experience was so rich for me, I offer you the same opportunity.</p>
            <p>Just sit quietly, center yourself down, and imagine that you are in that upper room, hearing the words of Christ Jesus speaking directly to you, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Feel his breath on your face. Breathe deeply, letting the Breath of God cleanse you down to your toes, allowing it to fill you with the absolute peace of God that “passes all understanding.” (Phil.4:7) Sit with that scene in your mind as long as is comfortable. When you are ready, conclude with the hymn as your prayer.</p>
            <p>“Breathe on me, Breath of God, fill me with life anew, that I may love what thou dost love, and do what thou wouldst do.</p>
            <p>“Breathe on me, Breath of God, until my heart is pure, until with thee I will one will, to do or to endure.</p>
            <p>“Breathe on me, Breath of God, till I am wholly thine, till all this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine.</p>
            <p>“Breathe on me, Breath of God, so shall I never die; But live with thee the perfect life of thine eternity.” Edwin Hatch</p>
