<p>In our gospel for today, John the gospeler lists by name four disciples of Jesus who were with Simon Peter when he decided to go fishing, and then he mentions “two others of his disciples”. I can't help but wonder who they were and why they were not named.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was Cleopas and his companion who were on their way to Emmaus when they met the Risen Jesus and recognized him in the breaking of the bread. (Lk. 24: 13-35) Or maybe it was “Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and. Matthias” who were considered as a replacement for Judas Iscariot as a witness to Christ Jesus’ resurrection.(Acts 1:23) Did the Gospeler not know their names or were they just too insignificant to specify? Often in scripture, ones who are unnamed are women. That, however, seems unlikely in this case, since the disciples were going fishing which was not considered women's work at the time. Pause for a bit and think about what these two others might mean for you today.</p>
<p>These two speak to me of all the untold others throughout history to whom God has revealed Christ Jesus and has called to be witnesses in their particular times and places, witnesses to how the Holy One continues to bring new life into the world. That is the message of resurrection that comes to us whenever we experience death in our life, however it may occur. It may be through loss of any kind, suffering of whatever sort, whatever brings us to a place of surrender and acceptance. That's when we will find new life bursting forth in our hearts and minds just as did those two others on the lakeshore with Peter and the risen Lord so long ago. The Holy One is ever at work, drawing us home into Divine Love, doing whatever is necessary to reach us right where we are.</p>
