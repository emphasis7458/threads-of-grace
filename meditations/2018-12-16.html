<p>In today’s gospel, John, the Baptizer, proclaims the good news that “One . . . is coming,” the One who those of his day have been waiting, the Anointed One, the Incarnation of God the Father, the One who brings the cleansing, refining fire of the Holy Spirit, the One who gathers the outcast and brings us home, the One who is near now and forever. It is clear that our response can only be to rejoice; just look at all the injunctions in the other lessons: “Sing aloud . . . shout . . . Rejoice and exult with all your heart!”, “Sing praises to the Lord . . . cry aloud . . . ring out your joy.”, “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.”</p>
<p>In the short term, it is often hard to find the inspiration to rejoice in the circumstances of our lives, but God is in it for the long haul. The Holy One has always used whatever we creatures offer and uses it to benefit us and the world. Think back to the time(s) in your own life when it felt like the very end of the world, but when you look at it through today’s eyes, you see what a blessing it has turned out to be after all. That has certainly happened in my life, more than once.</p>
<p>Remembering those times in my life and reflecting on the long-term consequences inspires me to sing the Canticle appointed for today from the First Song of Isaiah: “Surely it is God who saves me; I will trust in him and not be afraid. For the Lord is my stronghold and my sure defense, and he will be my Savior.” My heart is full to overflowing with the joy of knowing the Beloved, the One who is coming, the One who is here. It is time for me, and I hope for you, to rejoice!</p>
