            <p>The writer to the Hebrews speaks of Christ being “appointed” by God for his mission on earth, to incarnate God’s love so that our eyes would be open to perceive the reality of the Divine. We too are appointed for that same mission today, to love others as Christ loves us, unconditionally, compassionately, sacrificially. That may sound daunting at first glance, but since the Beloved has given us free will to accept or deny whatever God offers, we always can, and often do, reject that appointment for one reason or another. The good news, however, is that accepting the appointment will be life-changing as we allow ourselves to be transformed by God’s love into the imago dei, the image of God we were created to be.</p>
            <p>If we ever wonder: “Why am I here?” or “What is my purpose in life?” we discover that we are here to share God’s love, so freely given to us, with each and all, near and far, especially those who seem most unlovable. How we do that will be different for each of us according to the circumstances and situations of our lives, but in all cases, it will involve self-giving from the depths of our being, just as it did for Jesus.</p>
            <p>As we step out in faith, one day at a time, the Holy One encourages and upholds us, sustaining us with joy and wonder. We can trust God to open the doors of opportunity for our service, to lift all doubt, fear, insecurity that may face us as we stand before those doors, to enable us to cross those thresholds with courage and peace in our hearts, ready to incarnate Divine Love as we are gifted.</p>
