            <p>Prophets are folks who come to disturb our peace. Prophets rock the boat. Prophets shake us up. Prophets let us know in no uncertain terms that the status quo will not do. Prophets awaken us with awkward questions. Prophets open our eyes to the reality of the world so that our hearts can begin to see where we are going astray. Prophets call us to take a good look at ourselves, our self-centeredness, in comparison to God’s self-emptying, self-giving love for us. Prophets challenge us, individually and in community, to repent, to change, to be what God has created us to be.</p>
            <p>Prophets come to us, not only with warning and exhortation, but also with encouragement. Prophets bring us hope in the midst of despair. Prophets comfort and console us when we are overwhelmed with grief. Prophets nurture us when we are discouraged. Prophets intercede for us when we can’t pray for ourselves. Prophets hold us in their compassionate hearts. By one way or another, prophets lead us ever closer into the presence of God.</p>
            <p>Zechariah, in his prophetic hymn at the birth of his son John, who later became known as the Baptizer, recognized that God “has come to his people and set them free . . . and to guide our feet into the way of peace.” The Holy One continues to do that as God’s messengers, the prophets, come to each of us and all of us with the particular message we need to hear. Pause for a bit and think about who has been a prophet for you—who has filled the valleys, made the crooked straight, smoothed the rough places, and opened your eyes to see the salvation of God—and be glad.</p>
