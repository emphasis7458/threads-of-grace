            <p>The writer to the Hebrews speaks of the new and living way of Love that Christ Jesus continues to show us in the here and now. After more than over 2000 years, it hardly seems new, but indeed it is for each of us as we come to find our true heart deep within. We can at any time in our lives become open and receptive to all that God has promised, but for most of us, that happens in the second half of life, “the last of life for which the first was made” (Robert Burns). It’s as if we wake up to a new and living way of life; old things slough off, fall away, as we focus on God’s love working in our lives, our hearts, our minds, our spirits.</p>
            <p>As we live into Christ’s way of love, we begin to recognize that it is not a solo journey, that others may express it differently, but we are all on the way home to God who waits for us faithfully and patiently with open arms. Day by day we grow in love, sharing with others what we have received with joy and thanksgiving. As our hearts overflow with compassion and generosity, we can’t help but encourage others on the way, lifting up those who stumble and fall, holding up the light of Christ to those who walk in darkness.</p>
            <p>The apostle Paul tells us that “the whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now”(Rom.8:22), this fragile earth our island home, the entire cosmos, yearning for the tipping point of love to set it free. We can participate and co-operate with Christ Jesus in this new and living way by being God’s hands and feet and voice in the world around us. May it be so.</p>
