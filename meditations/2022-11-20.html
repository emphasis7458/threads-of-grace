<p>Today is the last Sunday of the liturgical year, the day each year when we celebrate Christ Jesus as “King of kings, Lord of lords” (Rev.19:16b). What does that really mean to us here and now? Kings, after all, aren’t part of our everyday experience. It might help to focus our attention on our second lesson from the epistle to the Colossians to see what insights may come.</p>
<p>To begin our reflection, let’s take a few deep breaths to settle down, to get comfortable with the scripture passage. As we read through it slowly, perhaps aloud if that is appropriate in our situation, we may notice a word or phrase that seems to resonate with us in some way. We can sit with that for a while, chewing on what it has to say to us today. We might look at each sentence separately, considering how it addresses the image of Christ as King, what illumination it provides us in our ongoing journey home to God, the Source and Essence of all. As we let the words soak into our minds and hearts, we may begin to feel the grace of unconditional and transformative divine Love imbuing us with peace and joy.</p>
<p>We may, at some point, come to realize that while Jesus is “the image of the invisible God,” so too were we created to be. We too, each and all, are indwelt by the Divine and are called to open ourselves more and more to that saving, healing Presence so that we may serve as God’s hands and feet and voice in our world, incarnating divine self-giving Love wherever we may be.</p>
