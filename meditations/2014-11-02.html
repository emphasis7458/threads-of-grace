            <p>In the Catechism (BCP, p.862) we find the question: “What is the communion of saints?” followed by the brief answer: “The communion of saints is the whole family of God, the living and the dead, those whom we love and those whom we hurt, bound together in Christ by sacrament, prayer, and praise.”</p>
            <p>“All Saints,” the communion of saints that we are celebrating today represents quite a mixed bag. The whole family of God is as inclusive as it gets—it’s a good thing there are “many mansions” (Jn.14:1-6,KJV) prepared for God’s children. It includes all God’s children alive today all around the world, as well as those who have gone before us. Our lesson from Revelation describes the latter according to one man’s vision; our gospel lesson describes what the life of the former may be like. As God’s children, we each have our part to play in the communion of saints, the mystical body of Christ.</p>
            <p>The catechism points out that those we love and those we hurt are all part of the communion of saints. It might have said, “those we love and those we don’t” as another way of being inclusive, but it doesn’t. Who are those we hurt? Those who are near and dear to us who don’t see things our way? Or are these the ones who are different from us in one way or another, whom we avoid if possible, whom we consider beyond the pale like the Samaritans of Jesus’ day? That’s something for us to consider as we reflect on the whole family of God—bound together in Christ—knit together in one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of Christ. We are interconnected with each and all by God’s love. May we come to appreciate that unbreakable bond and live into it day by day.</p>
