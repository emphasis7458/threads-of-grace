            <p>In our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures today, we have the background for the Jewish feast of Purim. It includes directions for the two-day celebration of the time “that had been turned from them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and presents to the poor.”</p>
            <p>What comes to mind as you focus on the description of their celebration? For me, Easter first popped up—not the specific details, of course, but the idea of turning “mourning into a holiday,” with Christ Jesus’ resurrection from the dead, and what a cause for rejoicing that is for us. That brought up Christmas, which may be a stretch to think of Jesus’ birth/incarnation as turning “sorrow into gladness,” but no doubt that is what Mary and Joseph experienced after their journey to Bethlehem and the safe delivery of the baby. Perhaps there is even a hint of Advent as we think of our preparation for celebrations. “Sending gifts of food” remains a central part of our celebrations, baking Christmas cookies for our neighbors, dying Easter eggs for children, sharing traditional foods at family gatherings. The “gifts of food” reminds me of another time in our lives when tradition moves us to take food to others: when there is a death in the family. As soon as my mother heard of a death in the community, she’d go to the kitchen and whip up a pie to deliver before dinner. That meant when my parents died, an over-abundance of comfort food appeared at our door which we shared with those eating at the local community center. The circle of Love in action!</p>
            <p>I expect that the Holy One is delighted when we celebrate the Divine Presence in our lives. I can imagine the Beloved smiling when Mother put on her apron and turned on the oven.</p>
