            <p>“The place where you are standing is holy ground.” We would do well to remember that. All creation is made by God, blessed by God, loved by God, made holy by God’s presence. Unfortunately it is easy for us to get bogged down in thinking only special places, things, people are holy, sacred, set apart for the worship of God. It comes from our dualistic perspective of the world, everything divided into good/evil, light/dark, us/them. We forget that Christ Jesus came to reconcile all our divisions, to bring us into oneness with God.</p>
            <p>This Lenten season is the time to strip away all we have allowed to separate us from God, from one another, from all creation, figuratively to take off our shoes as Moses did in our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures so that we may be reconciled with God. May whatever Lenten practices we choose to prepare us for the celebration of Easter enable us to become ever more aware that, no matter where we put our feet, we are standing on holy ground, standing in the presence of the Holy One, “unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid.”</p>
            <p>God is the very ground of our being, the source and essence of all. If only our eyes could be opened to see the Divine in each and all, if only our hearts could be opened to accept the reality of the oneness of all creation, the interdependence of animal, vegetable mineral, what a different world this would be. Nothing is impossible for God; remember, you are standing on holy ground.</p>
