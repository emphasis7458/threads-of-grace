            <p>“Come!” “Jesus calls us o’er the tumult of our life’s wild restless sea,” (Hymnal 1982, 549/550) as he did Peter in our gospel lesson. Be still for a moment, and listen. Can you hear his call? Come out of the stormy circumstances that threaten to overwhelm you and trust Christ Jesus to reach out his hand and lift you up out of the chaos of your lives.</p>
            <p>To the man in the synagogue with the withered hand, Jesus said, “Come forward.” (Mk.3:3) If today we want to be healed of whatever is withered in our lives, we have to come to Christ Jesus, to meet him halfway, to open ourselves to receive his healing touch. If we listen with the ears of our hearts, we may hear him say, “Come forward. Don’t hide on the periphery. Step into the midst of others and let them see my healing hand at work in your life.”</p>
            <p>“Come to me, all you that are weary and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.” (Mt.11:28) That was the same message Jesus gave to his disciples as they returned from their first mission to proclaim the gospel. (Mk. 6:31) Because Christ Jesus knows that a life of service to others can be exhausting, that when our energy is depleted, our souls cry out for replenishment, in his compassion, he promises rest in his presence when we come to him.</p>
            <p>Jesus called to Lazarus, long dead in the tomb, “Lazarus, come out!” No matter how long we have been lost in the darkness of death, we hear that same call today. Come out of all the things that have us bound in the grave cloths of sin and death. Come out into the light of Christ’s love. Come out and be freed to live a new life walking with the Lord at our side.</p>
            <p>“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.” (Lk.19:5b) The Greek word for “stay” means abide, dwell, remain. Jesus was saying that he wanted to become part of Zacchaeus’ life, and he wants to abide with us in the same way. He calls us to come down from whatever tree we may have climbed so that we may be with him here and now and allow him to make his home in our hearts.</p>
            <p>In one of Jesus’ resurrection appearances, we hear him call, “Come and have breakfast.” (Jn.21:12a) That call rings through the ages: “Come, come forward, come out, come down, come from wherever you are, and let me feed you with my love.”</p>
