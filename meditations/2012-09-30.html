            <p>The Church’s scriptural mandate for healing prayer comes from all the healings that Jesus accomplished in his ministry on earth, from his sending out his disciples to teach, preach, and heal (Mt. 10:1, Mk.6:7, 13, Lk.9:1-2), and especially from today’s passage in the epistle of James. “Are any among you sick? They should call for the elders of the church and have them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them up...“ Opportunities for participation in healing prayer for oneself and others abound at Trinity Church. Sunday by Sunday, a notebook is available at the entrance to the Nave for names of those we wish to remember in our liturgical Prayers of the People, which include prayers for healing, as well as prayers for protection, relief, comfort in grief, thanksgiving for answered prayer, for example. Each Sunday at 10:20, during the prelude to the main worship service, the altar is open for any who want to have prayer and anointing for themselves or those who may be laid on their hearts and minds for healing in body, mind, or spirit. On Wednesdays each week at 11:00 A.M., a Healing Eucharist with anointing is offered at the church—in the Memorial Garden on lovely days or in the church in case of inclement weather (or scraping and painting the buildings). For some years, Trinity Church has blessed and distributed prayer shawls as a way of sharing God’s blessings with those who are ill or their caregivers. Volunteers who feel called or inspired knit or crochet the shawls on their own schedule and offer them to the church. Knitting instructions are available on Trinity’s website: mytrinitychurch.org under Healing Ministry. We welcome your contributions. Often a shawl appears when a need surfaces, but currently three are needed, and the cupboard is bare. Perhaps you will recognize this call has your name on it. Trinity also provides a Prayer Chain for immediate intercessory prayer. Pray-ers on the Prayer Chain pass on the prayer request as they receive it and are committed to pray for 30 days unless they hear the prayer has been answered sooner. There is always room for additional pray-ers on the Prayer Chain. Please call the church office if you’d like to participate in Trinity’s Healing Ministry in this way. As James says, “ . . . and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of the righteous is powerful and effective.” People who have experienced it know that is true.</p>
