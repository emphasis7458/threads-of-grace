<p>The Easter season is traditionally a time of rejoicing, but in this time where the world is so consumed with anxiety about COVID-19, rejoicing can seem counter-cultural. Of course, when we stop to think about it, walking in the way of the cross is always counter-cultural. Today, I am awestruck to find how strongly I can relate to the words of our psalmist: "My heart is glad, and my spirit rejoices; my body also shall rest in hope." To even consider feeling such likely seems foolish to many; yet Saint Francis, in his simple, counter-cultural way, encourages us to be fools for Christ in our lives here and now.</p>
<p>When I read the epistle, I see why my heart is glad, why my spirit is rejoicing, why my body is resting in hope: "By [God's] great mercy, [God] has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading." How can we not rejoice for "the new covenant of resurrection" the Holy One has established for us? At a minimum we can rejoice inwardly in our hearts if the condition of the world is too threatening, too overwhelming to let our thankfulness and praise burst forth.</p>
<p>Trusting in that living hope, that sure and certain hope of God's steadfast love and everlasting mercy makes it easy to allow ourselves to rest in the Beloved's grace and peace, to accept and welcome all that comes our way day by day. We know, along with our psalmist, that "You [Lord] will show us the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy, and in your right hand are pleasures forevermore."</p>
