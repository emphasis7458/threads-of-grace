            <p>Whenever I read today's passage from James' Epistle, I am reminded of a story I heard years ago:</p>
            <p>A church service was underway. The congregation was seated in the pews. The ushers, having finished their early tasks, were sitting at the back of the nave when the door opened. A grungy-looking man, unkempt, with a several-days growth of beard, walked in. The nearest usher got up to deal with the interruption. The man walked past the usher, took off his hat and walked straight down the center aisle. As he neared the front, he sat down on the floor in the center of the aisle. It created a stir in the congregation, and the second usher stood up and walked down the aisle toward him. Everyone was looking around to see what would happen. As he reached the man, he sat down beside him, and the service continued.</p>
            <p>Picture that story taking place in your church. See the congregation in the pews. What is their response? What would happen when the service was over? Picture the man's reception at coffee hour. You know what the loving thing to do is, but do you do it, or do you hold back to see how others will react? Do you need to sit with that story for a bit, maybe journal with it to see what message it has for you today?</p>
            <p>I am always convicted by this story, afraid I would be one of those offended by the disruption marring our habit of doing things decently and in order, and judging the man by his appearance. I want to be the brave usher who disdained the thoughts of others and chose to love his neighbor. But I don't know how I would behave in the heat of the moment. Do you?</p>
