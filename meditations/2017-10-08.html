            <p>In our psalm today we hear the familiar words: "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer." That is the prayer in my mind and heart as I write these meditations week by week. It is a prayer we sometimes hear preachers use as they begin their sermons. Sunday school teachers, Bible study leaders, retreat directors, any who are called to proclaim God's word may find strength trusting in this prayer from our psalmist. Even more important than in teaching and preaching, however, is its application in our everyday interaction and communication with others.</p>
            <p>Jesus tells us, ". . . out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks," (Mt.12:34b) and " . . . what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart," (Mt.15:18a). We know that is true from our own experience. When we are angry or frustrated or hurt, our hearts tend to overflow with bile, and what comes out of our mouths is likely to be vile, hateful, attacking words. When, on the other hand, we are at peace, when our hearts are full of compassion and love for those around us, the words we utter can project harmony and healing balm into the world.</p>
            <p>What do our words say about our relationship with God and with one another, about the condition of our heart? Whenever we find unkind, malevolent words spewing forth from us, we might see them as a red flag serving notice that our heart is an unholy mess. The flag can alert us to turn our hearts to God asking, with renewed vigor, that the One Who Heals "cleanse the thoughts of our hearts," casting out all fear and anxiety, making us whole and holy. Only then can we be God's hands and feet and voice in the world, incarnating God's love, light, and peace here and now as we are called to be.</p>
