            <p>Listen to the good news of John: The light of the incarnate Word of God has come into being in our world, the light of all people, the true light which enlightens everyone. Not just the light for some people, not just for the ones who look like us, or talk like us, or worship like us, but for everyone—everyone—not one left out—ever.</p>
            <p>Our collect for today says that God has poured out the light of the incarnate Word on us, each and all. Do you feel that anointing? If not yet, sit quietly for a few minutes with your eyes closed, center down into the deep of your own being and let the light of Christ bathe you with the grace of God’s presence. Experience the light of Christ enkindling a fire of love in your heart. Let it warm you in every fiber of your being. Sit with that glow until it begins to fade away. Then open your eyes, and let that light shine through you onto the world around you.</p>
            <p>The light of the incarnate Word that God pours out is available to all, but we have to be open to receive it, to allow Christ Jesus to enlighten our own darkness, to be ready to let that light radiate through us to others. We are called to incarnate that Christ light in the here and now so that, as Isaiah reminds us, “The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light, those who lived in a land of deep darkness—on them light has shined.”(Is.9:2) We can see that much of our world continues to be steeped in evil, lost in deep darkness just as it was in the prophet’s day. The only way that light will shine there is for us to heed God’s call, to allow God’s love and peace and joy which fills our hearts to shine forth in our lives. That’s how God continues to send the Light of the World into its darkest corners so that none will stumble for lack of Christ’s light.</p>
