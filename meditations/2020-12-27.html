            <p>God always comes in the fullness of time, at the right time, at the appropriate time. When we are ready to receive '"the light that shines in darkness" into our hearts, our eyes will be opened to recognize the Divine in our midst. Mary was ready and willing, thank goodness. So was Paul on the road to Damascus (Acts 5), and the Ethiopian eunuch on his way home from Jerusalem (Acts 8:26-39), and Cornelius, the centurion in Caesarea. (Acts 10) May we be so today.</p>
            <p>"God waits patiently as we wander, rebel, go our own ways, and in various forms get lost. As a loving heavenly parent, God waits patiently for us to come to our senses, waits patiently for the eyes of our heart to be enlightened. God is there, scanning the horizon for the first glimpse of you and me. Finding first sight of us, God runs wildly to welcome the returning home." (Br. Luke Ditewig, SSJE) Can you picture that? Do you realize that the Holy One is waiting for us to open our hearts to accept the Divine Love prepared for us to share with the world here and now in this Christmas season?</p>
            <p>Nan Merrell in her Psalms for Praying provides a prayer that we might use in readying ourselves for the fullness of time in our lives:</p>
            <p>"May I come to live with patience,<br>
waiting for your perfect timing in all circumstances.<br>
May tolerance make its home in me,<br>
as I recognize you in every heart.<br>
May I be imbued with goodness, and<br>
make room for kindness in all situations." (Ps.119:69-72)</p>
            <p>And may "the true light, which enlightens everyone" radiate through us in the fullness of time.</p>
