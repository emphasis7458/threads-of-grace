<p>Our God longs to be known and is ever trying to reveal Godself to us. Unfortunately, we are so often consumed by our culture and the quotidian expectations of our lives that we miss the divine knock at our door (Rev. 3:20). We may over time come to know a lot about God, who God is, what God does, but we don't begin to know the Beloved intimately until we spend time together, until we detach from the ways of the world and focus on God. As we let the Holy One move from our heads to our hearts and open ourselves to the presence and action of God in our lives, we can begin to see how ineffable the reality of divine love is. There is always more of the yet unknown to experience, to know deep within the enfolding embrace of God.</p>
<p>No matter how unknown God may be to us, we are not unknown to God. Sunday by Sunday, at every Eucharist, we acknowledge that "unto [God] all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid"(BCP, p.355). ALL hearts, not just yours and mine, not just Christians or Americans, but all hearts--every last one--all around the world, are open to the Holy One. Remember both Peter and Paul came to know that God shows no partiality (Acts 10:34, Rms 2:11) among us or between us, whoever or wherever we are. Each and all with all our warts exposed are loved by the One who called us into being, and nothing can ever separate us from that love.</p>
<p>We are invited into union with the Holy One here and now. May we respond to God's knock at the door of our hearts and welcome the Beloved. We can trust God's abiding presence to fill us with peace and joy in the knowing.</p>
