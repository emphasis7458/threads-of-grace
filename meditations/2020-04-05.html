        <div class="meditation-content">
            <p>Matthew 21:1-11, Psalm 118:1-2, 19-29</p>
            <p>Liturgy of the Word</p>
            <p>Isaiah 50:4-9a, Psalm 31:9=16, Philippians 2:5-11, Matthew 26:14--27:66</p>
            <p>At Trinity Church in Apalachicola, for many of the years we were there, on Palm Sunday we gathered outside the church, pinned on our palm crosses, picked up palm fronds, participated in the Liturgy of the Palms, and processed counterclockwise around the Church property, led by a kilt-clad bagpiper playing "Amazing Grace". It was a spirited way to celebrate Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem. As we made our procession around and back to the front steps, there was gaiety and laughter, and even some shouts of "Hosanna" just as it had been in Jesus' day.</p>
            <p>All that changed as we made our way up the stairs and into the nave to find our seats. The reality of Holy Week opening before us as the lessons from the Hebrew scriptures and the Epistle were read. Then came the painful reading of the passion gospel with a narrator and some of the congregants taking the speaking parts. Every year when the whole congregation shouts, "Let him be crucified!" (in Mt.'s gospel), my heart never fails to be convicted of all the ways I continue to cause pain to the Beloved. How vulnerable I feel, recognizing my need for his mercy and grace today and everyday.</p>
            <p>Hosanna in Hebrew means "Help" or "Save, I pray", and today it becomes my whispered prayer through Holy Week, trusting the Holy One to sanctify the time so that when I arise on Easter morning I will be filled with vibrant Hosannas as the exclamation of praise it was when Jesus rode into Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>HOSANNA!</p>
