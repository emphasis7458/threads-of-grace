<div class="meditation-content">
<p>Years ago I read a book entitled But God inspired by this phrase in our lesson today from the Hebrew scriptures that Joseph spoke to set his brothers free from their guilt. It is unlikely that Joseph felt that way in the beginning when his brothers sold him into slavery, nor during his years of slavery in Egypt. But after all those years and finally coming to recognize how God was working in his life, using him to save the people from famine, he could take the long view. "It was not you who sent me here, but God."</p>
<p>When we are in the midst of distress and pain, it is difficult, if not impossible, to see beyond our immediate circumstances. Indeed, it is most often in retrospect that we begin to realize that God is always with us, especially when we find ourselves in dire situations where we have no control. As we reflect on the past, our eyes can be opened to see how God has been at work in our lives day by day, lighting the way one step at a time, going before us to make the rough places smooth, and we find that trust is brought forth in us as it was for Joseph.</p>
<p>The psalmist knew well that the wicked can triumph temporarily, but he trusted that God would take care of them in God's time, in God's way: "They will wither like the grass ... and fade away," ... "In a little while the wicked will be no more." He knew well the power of trusting in God and adjures us to "Commit your way to the Lord and put your trust in him," ... "Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him." Our times are in God's hands just as much as Joseph's were, even though it may take the view from 30,000 feet to see it. It may seem dismal all around us, but God always takes the long view.</p>
