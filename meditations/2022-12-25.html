            <p>The prophet Isaiah proclaimed, “The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who lived in a land of deep darkness—on them light has shone.” He could see that reality for the people of Israel, which we recognize occurred with the birth of Jesus over 2100 years ago. But the truth of his proclamation happens over and over through the centuries for people who find themselves walking in darkness—for people collectively and individually. In the land of deep darkness, God comes. It is the place of encounter with divine Presence.</p>
            <p>The shepherds in our gospel lesson, watching their flocks through the long, dark night in the fields outside the city, were in a truly deep darkness we can hardly imagine in our electrified age. All of a sudden a great light appeared; “the glory of the Lord shone around them.” Of course, they were terrified at first, awe-struck with the divine encounter as the angel gave them the good news of God’s in-breaking into humanity. That tends to be our reaction as well when the Holy One shows up in the darkness of our lives—surprise, shock, wonder, awe at the power and reality of the encounter.</p>
            <p>The questions begin to arise as we come to grips with what we have experienced. What does it mean? What shall we do as a result of the encounter? Who do we tell about our encounter? How can we share how the encounter has impacted our lives? And on and on, until, like the shepherds, we return to our daily lives renewed, restored, “glorifying and praising God” for all the ways the Beloved works in our hearts and minds and spirits.</p>
            <p>HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST!</p>
