<p>The church in which I grew up was Protestant, not liturgical, yet certain things tended to be traditional, or habitual perhaps. At the end of each service, the minister made his way to the door as we sang the final hymn. There he (it was always “he” in those days) pronounced on the assembled congregation the Aaronic blessing we have in our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures today: “The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.” Because of that association, the blessing feels like an old friend, both comfortable and a comfort.</p>
<p>Sitting with the words of the blessing, letting them soak into my being far deeper than they ever did all those years ago, I realize how perfect it is for this day, the beginning of another new year in our lives, in our nation, in our world. I offer it as my blessing to you and for you to share with those you know are in need of God’s blessing in this new year that is opening before us.</p>
<p>I think I will add it to my New Year’s tradition of starting with greens and black-eyed peas. What about you?</p>
<p>The Lord bless you and keep you;</p>
<p>the Lord make his face to shine upon you, and be gracious to you;</p>
<p>the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace.</p>
