            <p>The passage we read today from Paul’s letter to the Ephesians is a powerful statement of the Church’s role as the body of Christ in the world and our place in it. Take time to read it over again now. See what phrases(s) grabs your attention; how is it speaking to you this day? Are you being moved to action of some kind? Can you hear the “still, small voice” of God calling you by name, urging you to pay attention? If so, what is your response? It may be prayer of some kind: adoration, praise, thanksgiving, contrition, intercession. As the energy of your prayer fades, you may find yourself simply resting in the presence of God.</p>
            <p>Several phrases had my name on them. “. . . with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love” speaks to me—as the way of Jesus in his life on earth, as a way of life for us to strive for day by day, no matter how often we may fail. Then “. . . to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of Christ” follows on describing the goal of the transforming work that God is carrying out in our lives here and now, bringing us to completion as the image of God we were created to be. Finally, “. . . building itself [Christ’s body, the Church] up in love” focuses on the work we are called to do as we love one another as Christ loves us.</p>
            <p>When we let Love lead the way, we experience God’s grace pouring through us in truth, in forgiveness, in patience. Acknowledging, accepting, appreciating our sisters and brothers in all their differences from us is the first step. That’s how we participate in the building up of the Church in unity, in harmony, in peace.</p>
