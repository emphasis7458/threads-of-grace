            <p>In Jesus’ parable in today’s gospel, we see the realm of God described as overwhelming, unexpected generosity—in the Presence of God. We find it is pure grace—nothing we have earned through our own efforts, but freely and lovingly given from the merciful heart of God. Like the example in our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures of providing manna in the wilderness, and the quails for good measure, God gives and gives and gives some more in an effort to show us how to love one another.</p>
            <p>Jesus, the Incarnate Love of God, comes to demonstrate the ultimate self-giving of God, to show what it is like to be God’s love in the here and now. We may not be called to give up our physical lives in loving service of others as Jesus did, but it may feel like that as we die to our self-centered ways of feeling, thinking, and acting. That’s what Jesus is trying to get across to his disciples when he calls them to “deny themselves and take up their cross and follow [him].” (Mt. 16:25) For most of us, it takes the transforming hand of God working deep within us to turn us from “what’s in it for me” folks into the “cheerful givers” (II Cor.9:7) God wants us to be, into givers who don’t count the cost of a generous, compassionate heart, of givers who know the joy of being there for others in whatever way may be needed.</p>
            <p>All life is gift, every breath we take; all creation is gift, the entire cosmos, from the Divine Giver, the Source of All that Is. Our part in the Giver’s economy is to keep the gifting circle going, to give generously what we receive from the heart of Love, trusting in Jesus’ guidance to “give and it will be given you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.” (Lk.9:38)</p>
