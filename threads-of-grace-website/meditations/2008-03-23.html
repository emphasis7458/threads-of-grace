            <p>Do you hear it?  It is the sound of Easter, the sound of the stone being rolled away from the entrance to the tomb.  It is the sound of an incredulous voice announcing the disappearance of Jesus’ body.  It is the sound of running feet, hurrying to verify the empty tomb.  It is the sound of awe in the disciples’ voices as they discover the discarded grave clothes.  It is the sound of exultation and victory.</p>
            <p>Today churches all around the world are pulling out all the stops, employing organ crescendo, trumpet and timpani with the most joyous melodies for choirs and congregations to ring out the sound of Easter.  Indeed, there is a veritable feast for all the senses with the rich fragrance of incense, lilies, and other brightly colored spring flowers that deck the altar and every other available surface, the taste of bread and wine on the tongue, the touch of reconciling peace, and perhaps, as we have at Trinity, a blooming cross in the nave created with the children’s hand-picked bouquets.  They all combine to enable us to celebrate the victory of our Lord over death and the grave, to exult with thanks and praise for the promise of our own resurrection.</p>
            <p>Long before the incarnation of Christ, long before his death and resurrection, the psalmist experienced the joy of recognizing the saving grace of the Lord at work in his life.  His words resonate in our minds and hearts as we make his song our own: “There is a sound of exultation and victory in the tents of the righteous: ‘The right hand of the Lord has triumphed! the right hand of the Lord is exalted!’… This is the Lord’s doing and it is marvelous in our eyes.  On this day the Lord has acted; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”</p>
            <p>Our Easter acclamation is ever and always “a sound of exultation and victory”: Alleluia!  Christ is risen! The Lord is risen indeed!  Alleluia!</p>
