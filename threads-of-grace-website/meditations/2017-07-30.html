<p>In today’s gospel, it seems to me that Jesus is realizing his followers are not yet getting his message about God’s domain, what Matthew calls the kingdom of heaven. Because he knows we are, each and all, unique in God’s creation, I think it’s likely that here he tries a variety of short parables, hoping one will reach through the fog of our lives and touch our hearts. He asks those present at that time, “Have you understood all this?” Christ Jesus is asking the same of us today.</p>
<p>Take some time to reflect on these parables. Read each one slowly, expecting the ears of your heart to be opened to what God has for you today. Respond to the Holy One in some way that feels right for you, perhaps it will be gratitude and thanksgiving or maybe frustration that your expectations weren’t met. You may feel led to express your response in song or art or journaling or merely resting in the Beloved’s presence.</p>
<p>Consider how this group of parables speaks to you. Today I see the abundance of God’s love showing through, the fecundity of life in the Divine Presence, the potential for my deepening relationship with the Beloved, the need to be open to change and to be welcoming to God’s transforming work in my life, allowing the refining fire of the Holy Spirit to consume the dross that continues to cling, and the call to share what I have received. Because we all have such different life experiences and are in such different places in our spiritual journeys, what we see in this group of parables will be different. As I’ve said so often, “God meets us where we are, as we are,” God knows just how to reach our hearts so that we may experience the power of Divine Love in ways we can recognize as our treasure deep within.</p>
