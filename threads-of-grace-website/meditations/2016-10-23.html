<p>What we today know as the Jesus Prayer: “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner,” is based on the tax collector’s prayer in our gospel. According to tradition, it comes to us from a Russian pilgrim of yore who, on his journeys, prayed the prayer so continuously that it became a part of his very breath, the balm of Divine Presence from deep within. Through the centuries, pray-ers have found it to be a comfort, a refuge when other words won’t come, the perfect cry for help in the darkness of despair.</p>
<p>I remember Madeleine L’Engle sharing what a treasure it had been for her in a shattering experience in her life. She had flown to California for a speaking engagement. The cab taking her from the airport was involved in a major accident, and she was rushed unconscious to the hospital where she was operated on for massive, life-threatening injuries. It took a while for her family to be notified and to rally round her. In those fearful, lonely, pain-filled, medicated days, she said the only thing that kept her going was the Jesus Prayer, trusting in the Beloved’s presence to bring her through her confusion and distress.</p>
<p>Folks who use the Jesus Prayer regularly, or even often, find it tends to shorten itself with the repetition—maybe it becomes simply “Jesus, mercy.” Some people find it a helpful prayer to use with a knotted prayer rope or an Anglican rosary. Others may use it as a breath prayer as they walk or struggle through rush-hour traffic. Like all our prayers, it is individual and fits itself into our hearts with use. If you’re not currently using it as a spiritual practice, try it in some way for thirty days and notice what happens. I suspect you will be surprised to discover how God uses it in your life.</p>
