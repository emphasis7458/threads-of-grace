            <p>Matthias was on the second string; he was a bench-warmer to use a sports metaphor. He had been one of Jesus’ disciples from the beginning, a faithful follower from Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan, through his active ministry, his death and resurrection, to his ascension. While Matthias was not chosen to be in the starting line-up, one of the original twelve closest associates of Jesus, perhaps he was one of the seventy (Lk.10:1) that Jesus sent out to proclaim the good news of God’s love. Clearly, he was not one of those who turned back when Jesus’ teaching became too tough to bear (Jn.6:66).Through it all, Matthias persevered and was ready when the call came to fill the vacancy in the apostles’ line-up, to be Christ Jesus’ witness “in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8) and to go and “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them . . . and teaching them . . . “ (Mt. 28:19).</p>
            <p>That call echoes down through the ages. When the ears of our hearts are open to hear our names being called, will we be ready to step up to the plate, to take our place in the roster? Will Christ Jesus find us steadfast in our faith, sanctified by the Holy Spirit, armored with the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God (Eph.6:13-17)? Matthias can be a role model for us, following Jesus wherever he leads, ready to take our turn on the playing field when the lot falls on us.</p>
