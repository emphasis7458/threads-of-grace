        <div class="meditation-content">
            <p>The word of the Lord comes to us today through the prophet Zephaniah who proclaims that God is “in your midst.” And if we didn’t get it the first time, the prophet reiterates that God is “in your midst . . . ; he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will renew you in love; he will exult over you.” That good news has our name on it! Each and all, believe it or not. The prophet Isaiah also knew that that truth as the canticle reminds us, “ . . . for the great one in the midst of you is the Holy One of Israel.”</p>
            <p>Our linear conception of time tends to confuse us in the Advent season, as we prepare to celebrate Christ Jesus’ birth 2000 years ago and look forward to his coming again, all the while trusting in Emmanuel (God is with us—Mt. 1:23) here and now. We hear Jesus say, “. . . and remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.”(Mt.28:20b) And elsewhere, “For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.” (Mt.18:20) The Presence of God is indwelling, enfolding all creation with the mystery of Love.</p>
            <p>We somehow know in our hearts that “The Lord is near,” always and everywhere. It is time to rejoice as the apostle Paul urges the Philippians, welcoming the Divine Presence in our midst. No matter what the day has to offer, sunshine or rain, rough roads or smooth, we can trust that the Holy One, the Source and Essence of all, will surround and uphold us with “the peace that surpasses all understanding.” We can rejoice in what is, what has been, and what is to come, aware that nothing can ever separate us from God’s love.</p>
