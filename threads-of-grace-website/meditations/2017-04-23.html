<div class="meditation-content">

<p>We are called to be witnesses of the new life of Christ’s resurrection that we experience here and now. 2000 years after that first Easter, “to show forth in [our] lives what [we] profess by [our] faith.” We weren’t there with Mary Magdalene at the tomb, nor in the house with the disciples when Christ Jesus appeared in their midst, nor with the couple on the way to Emmaus, nor with those who were fishing when the Risen Lord called them to breakfast. They were eye-witnesses; they each had their personal testimony of what they had experienced in his presence.</p>
<p>We are among “those who have not seen and yet have come to believe” whom Christ blessed in our gospel today. We have our own stories of how we came to believe in the Living Christ, of how we have experienced the reality of new life appearing out of the desolations of our lives. That is our witness, our personal testimony that no one else has, that no one else can share with the world. That task might seem daunting at first, but if we are alert, we’ll notice opportunities appearing where someone needs to hear how we have experienced the Risen Lord. All we have to do is open our mouth, and God will take care of the rest. We can trust that God will use our witness, whatever it may be, when we have the courage to share our experience of the divine at work in our lives.</p>
