            <p>The denomination in which I grew up is celebrating its 200th birthday this year. In 1810, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church separated from the Presbyterian Church over the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. Its credo is: “Whosoever will may come.” It was founded by Scots Irish pioneers in the wilds of the Middle Tennessee frontier near what is now the town of Dickson. The cabin where those founding fathers met on that momentous occasion is now preserved in the Montgomery Bell State Park near there. I don’t remember the details of their prayerful discussions, but as I ponder our epistle lesson for today, I can’t help but wonder if these words of Paul to the Roman Christians inspired them: “For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and is generous to all who call upon him. For ‘Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’ (Joel 2:32) “</p>
            <p>“Lord of all” says to me that none are excluded from the kingdom of God; none are left out. It doesn’t matter to God what language we use to call upon the name of the Lord, nor does the “name” itself. Some say there are a thousand names of God. Perhaps you have some special name you use in the intimacy of your prayer time with God; I do. God desires a deepening personal relationship with each and everyone of us throughout the world; the method of worship and praise that we choose to express and celebrate this relationship is irrelevant in God’s economy. It is when we begin to think that God wants only folks that look like us, think like us, speak like us, worship like us, when we try to circumscribe God’s “all” that we go astray. I believe that “whosoever will may come” to God in whatever way communicates the sincerity of our faith, the offering of our hearts and minds to the Lord. Perhaps that is just my Cumberland Presbyterian roots, but it rings true in my experience of God. Does it resonate with you?</p>
            <p>“There is no distinction between Jew and Greek, [between European and African, Asian and Australian, North American and South American—all of us creatures are equal in the eyes of the Creator]; the same Lord is Lord of all,” absolutely ALL.</p>
