<p>Our psalmist for today sums up his experience of God’s work in the world with the admonition: “Whoever is wise will ponder these things and consider well the mercies of the Lord.” How wise are we? We may read scripture every day, but how often do we take time to ponder what it has to say to us today? Scripture is the word of God intended to encourage, challenge, bless, and convict us as we may need it at the time. It behooves us to pay attention, to listen with the ears of our hearts to what the Beloved has prepared for us today, not only in scripture, but also in creation. Meister Eckhart has said the creation is the first Bible. The apostle Paul a similar point in Romans 1:19-20a. Creation includes both our neighbors near and far and the circumstances in which we find ourselves in the world.</p>
<p>The Holy One brings people into our lives when we need them or when they need us. Recently, I was on my way to a meeting when I ran into a neighbor in the parking lot. It was clear she had been crying and needed to talk. It didn’t take much pondering to know I needed to listen, but I know that earlier in my life, I very likely would have greeted her and rushed off to my appointment, her need unnoticed. It takes a lot of living to become even the least bit wise enough to recognize and consider the mysterious mercies of God.</p>
<p>As I was meditating on “pondering”, I kept hearing over and over a phrase from a familiar hymn: “Ponder anew what the Almighty can do.” Take time to let that phrase soak into you. Looking it up online, I found it in the Episcopal Hymnal 1982, #390, “Praise to the Lord.” I offer it to you as you “ponder. . . and consider well” how God is working in your life and in the world around you here and now, and give thanks.</p>
