            <p>In our culture, the concept of bearing fruit carries with it the notion that it is the result of hard work. It is being productive, effective, accomplishing goals, having something to show for our effort. But maybe there’s another way to look at bearing fruit, a different perspective on where fruit comes from. A few verses earlier than our gospel passage for today, in this same chapter of John’s gospel, Jesus says, “I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.”(15:5) I don’t know about you, but the image of abiding is about being, not doing. That casts a different light on bearing fruit. Grape vines and fruit trees are being just what they are, what God designed them to be, when we find delicious fruit on them ripe and ready to be picked and eaten. For me, then, bearing fruit is the result more of inner work than outer work.</p>
            <p>Fruitful inner work involves being in intimate relationship with the Lord, welcoming the nurturing sap of God’s steadfast love, allowing each tiny emerging bud to burst into bloom and the full-blown flower to fade and drop away letting the fruit come forth, and trusting in the transforming touch of God’s hand to bring forth just the fruit the world needs at this time and in this place.</p>
            <p>Just as Jesus chose those first disciples to bear fruit, so he chooses us today, calling us, each and all, by name. When we respond and cultivate our relationship with the Lord day by day, we can expect fruit to appear in due season. As odd as it may seem, however, we may never notice the fruit ripening on our own branches. Our fruit is meant to feed others, and those who are hungry for whatever fruit God brings forth from us will somehow be brought to enjoy what we have to offer. When we abide in the Lord, we will bear fruit that will last.</p>
