                    <p>For over sixteen years, Pat Horn faithfully crafted weekly meditations on the Sunday lectionary readings, weaving together scripture, spiritual wisdom, and personal reflection. Her dedication to this practice resulted in an extraordinary legacy—nearly 850 meditations covering the entire liturgical calendar.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each meditation, which she calls "Threads of Grace," invites readers to pause, reflect, and discover God's presence in the ordinary moments of life. Pat's gentle yet profound voice guides seekers toward deeper encounters with the Divine.</p>
