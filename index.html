                <div class="hero-text">
                    <p>From December 2007 through March 2024, Pat Horn faithfully crafted weekly meditations on the Sunday lectionary readings—848 reflections following the rhythms of the church year. What began as a personal spiritual practice became a ministry reaching readers across the country.</p>

                    <p>Each meditation invites readers into a contemplative encounter with scripture. Drawing on the wisdom of mystics from Julian of Norwich to Thomas Merton, Pat writes as a fellow traveler walking the path herself. Her gentle voice guides seekers toward stillness, presence, and deeper awareness of God's indwelling love.</p>

                    <p>Whether you are new to contemplative spirituality or have practiced for years, these meditations offer companions for the journey.</p>

            <h2>About Pat Horn</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Pat Horn is a spiritual companion, retreat leader, and writer whose work bridges the contemplative traditions of the Church with the realities of daily life. Her meditations draw freely from Benedictine, Ignatian, Carmelite, and Celtic streams, offering readers multiple entry points into prayer.</p>

                <p>Pat finds kinship with mystics across traditions—Meister Eckhart and Rumi, Julian of Norwich and Thich Nhat Hanh—who describe remarkably similar territory: the emptying of the false self, the discovery of divine presence within, the path from separation toward union. She trusts that the Holy One is too large to be confined by any single tradition, reaching out to each person where they are, in the way they can best hear. This perennial wisdom runs through her meditations like a quiet underground stream.</p>

                <p>She has led numerous retreats and quiet days and has been published in <em>Forward Day by Day</em> and elsewhere. Pat is an Associate of the Community of the Holy Spirit, a religious order for women in the Episcopal Church, and a graduate of the Lay School at Virginia Theological Seminary.</p>

                <p>Her approach to spiritual formation emphasizes accessible practices: Centering Prayer, lectio divina, the daily examen, and the "Seven Sacred Pauses" throughout the day. She writes not as an academic but as a fellow traveler who has discovered that "the Holy One is nearer than our very breath."</p>
