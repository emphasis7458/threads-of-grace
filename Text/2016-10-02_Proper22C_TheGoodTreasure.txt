THE GOOD TREASURE

The writer of our epistle lesson speaks of “the good treasure” that has been entrusted to us. When you reflect on the meaning of that phrase and what it represents in your life today, what comes to mind? I first thought about the “spirit of power, and of love, and of self-discipline” that the passage affirms as God’s gifts to us. But then my mind wandered to the seven-fold gifts of the Spirit itemized in Isa.11:2. My meditation continued with considering the possibility of the “blesseds” that Jesus pointed out in what we call his Sermon on the Mount (Mt.5:3-11) being the good treasure. Then I focused on the virtues we know as the fruit of the Spirit enumerated in Gal.5:22-23 that come forth in our lives as our relationship with the Divine grows deeper, stronger. Yet none quite seemed to fit my image of God’s good treasure in my life today.

I then imagined a treasure chest partially sunk in the sand on a deserted beach—such as we often picture a pirate’s booty. You might try that. The beach was white sand with gentle waves lapping at the tide line, much like St. George Island. It was quiet, peaceful. I walked over to the wooden chest and scraped away the sand holding it aslant. When I had it cleaned off, I set it up straight and worked to unlatch the badly corroded metal fittings, wondering all the while what I would find inside. I slowly lifted the lid, trusting I would see the good treasure the Holy One had entrusted to me. There I saw an icon of the Virgin of the Sign, where Mary stands praying with her hands upraised in the orans position. In the center of her being is Christ Jesus. She is completely surrounded by the glory of God.

To me it speaks of the enfolding, indwelling Love of God. That is my good treasure to share with you and the world. What good treasure did you discover and how are you being called to use it?
