The Seventh Sunday of Easter, Year A

Acts 1:6-14, Psalm 86:1-10, 33-36, I Peter 4:12-14, 5:6-11, John 17:1-11

THE GOD OF ALL GRACE

In our second lesson today we can be encouraged as we hear: “. . . the God of all grace . . .will himself restore, support, strengthen, and establish you.” God, the Source and Essence of all, “in whom we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28), knows our every need and through Grace supplies the resources we require to grow in our relationship with the Divine. As our eyes are opened to be aware of God’s grace at work in our lives, our hearts become filled with trust in the Divine Presence enfolding and indwelling us day by day.

The psalmist today recognizes God’s grace in rain on dry land: “You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon your inheritance; you refreshed the land when it was weary.”(68:9) We know what that feels like, how our landscapes flourish after a shower following a hot dry season. We respond in like manner as Grace is poured into our dry souls. That brings to mind the old gospel hymn written by Daniel Whittle, “ There Shall Be Showers of Blessing.”

“There shall be showers of blessing;

This is the promise of love;

There shall be seasons of refreshing,

Sent from the Savior above.

Showers of blessing,

Showers of blessing we need.

Mercy-drops round us are falling,

But for the showers we plead.”

And we give thanks to the God of all grace whose gracious love is new every day, refreshing us, leading us home.
