GOD’S HOLY PLACE

Where is God’s holy place? It is the psalmist who inspires the question in verse 3 and provides the answer: “The earth is the Lord’s and all that is in it, the world [the cosmos] and all who dwell therein.” In other words, not just one holy place; rather the entire creation is holy, endowed with God’s grace, sanctified by God’s love.

Creation is the place of encounter, where God chooses to reveal the divine presence to us in whatever way we may be open to receive it. Take a few moments to think about your encounters with the Holy One over the years, the times, the places, the situations. What has been your response? For most of us, initially it is wonder, overwhelming awe, absolute amazement as we realize the manifestation of God’s presence right here, right now, right out of the blue. Then maybe gratitude fills our hearts and spills over into thanksgiving and praise for all the ways we experience God at work in our life.

As we reflect on our experiences of the Divine Presence, we surely begin to notice that there is no place that is taboo for God to use to reach us. In fact, the more unlikely to our rational mind, the more likely the Beloved will surprise us in God’s holy place, opening our hearts with joy and delight, inviting us to join in the divine dance of love.
