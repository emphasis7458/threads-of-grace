The Second Sunday after the Epiphany, Year B

I Samuel 3:1-10 (11-20), Psalm 139:1-5, 12-17, I Corinthians 6:12-20, John 1:43-51

THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

Our collect for today declares Christ Jesus is the Light of the World, the title that Jesus claims for himself (Jn.8:12) and conveys to his disciples (Mt.5:14), and hence to us in this day and age. What an awesome responsibility! One, we humbly acknowledge, we cannot shoulder alone, but only as the Holy One enlightens us day by day can we even begin.

As I ponder where to begin, the first thing that comes to my mind is that old hymn, “Brighten the Corner where You Are.” That begins to whittle the task down to my size, something I may be able to handle with God’s help. My little corner of the world is the only place where I can make a difference. It may be as simple as following Paul’s injunction to the Ephesians to: “be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving each other.” (KJV 4:32a) Kindness, gentleness, patience, and generosity of spirit go a long way toward alleviating the darkness in all our corners. Try it and see.

This evening when it gets dark outside, take a candle--it can be an electric one for safety’s sake—light it and take it into a dark room with no other light source. What happens? Immediately, I suspect, you will see the shapes of the furniture in the room. Now hold the candle over your head; how does the visibility change? At the University of Tennessee, a Torchbearer is one of whom it is said “ shadoweth himself to give light to others”—an example of generous self-giving, a Christ figure.

The light of Christ has come into the world; let us lift high the torch of Love in the darkness of our corners, trusting God to enlighten us as we share our light with others.
