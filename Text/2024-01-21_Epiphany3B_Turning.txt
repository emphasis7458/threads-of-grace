The Third Sunday after Epiphany, Year B

Jonah 3:1-5, 10, Psalm 62:6-14, I Corinthians 7:29-31, Mark 1: 14-20

Turning

Scripture tells us that when they foreigners of Nineveh heard Jonas’ warning from God, “they turned from their evil ways”. Would that we, each and all, were so responsive to the Holy One in our day. In our Gospel lesson, Simon and Andrew, James and John, turned from their livelihood, their fishing nets, to follow Jesus on the way. “Immediately”, Mark tells us. What it will take for us to recognize our need here and now to turn, to live into metanoia, to turn from our consuming self-centeredness, and turn toward kindness, compassion, and love, the way of God?

The Apostle Paul in his letter to the Corinthians urges his readers to be prepared “for the present form of this world is passing away”. He seemed to think that Christ's second coming was immediate; we, on the other hand, more than 2000 years later seem to think there's no hurry. I have a priest friend who prefaces the final blessing in the Eucharistic liturgy with these words:

“Life is short, and we have little time

to gladden the hearts of those who travel with us,

so be quick to love, and make haste to be kind.” That casts a different light on Paul's words, because the present form of our personal world is indeed passing away day by day, whether we are aware of it or not. Now is the time to turn.

These thoughts of turning bring to mind the Shakers’ hymn we know as “Simple Gifts” (Hymnal 1982, #554). Years ago, I led my retreatants in a simple circle dance where we physically turned on the last line: “to turn, turn will be our delight, till by turning, turning, we come round right”. You might try that for yourself to get in the mood to turn toward the Beloved today.
