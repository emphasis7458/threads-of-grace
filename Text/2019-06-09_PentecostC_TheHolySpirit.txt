THE HOLY SPIRIT

The Church celebrates the coming of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, fifty days after Easter, ten days after the celebration of Christ Jesus’ Ascension. Recently, in Richard Rohr’s Daily Meditations, he shared a prayer litany he had composed some years previously on a retreat—“imagining many names and moments of the Spirit—to awaken and strengthen the Presence in us.”

Today, as part of our celebration, I invite you to read and pray each name, noticing which ones speak to you of your experience of the Holy Spirit:

Pure Gift of God Indwelling Presence Promise of the Father

Life of Jesus Pledge and Guarantee Defense Attorney

Inner Anointing Homing Device Stable Witness

Peacemaker Always Already Awareness Compassionate Observer

God Compass Inner Breath Mutual Yearning

Hidden Love of God Implanted Hope Seething Desire

Fire of Life and Love Truth Speaker Flowing Stream

Wind of Change Descending Dove Cloud of Unknowing

Uncreated Grace Filled Emptiness Deepest Level of Longing

Sacred Wounding Holy Healing Will of God

Great Compassion Inherent Victory

You who pray in us, through us, with us, for us, and in spite of us.

Amen, Aleluia!

On concluding the litany, take some time to reflect on your experience of the Spirit and consider what names for the divine Comforter and Healer you would add to his litany. For me, I would add at least two: Enfolding One and Companioning Presence, plus the traditional Ruach and Paraclete. As the Spirit works in each of our lives uniquely, I suspect you’ll have others.
