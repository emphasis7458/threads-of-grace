“THE ANGELS WAITED ON HIM”

Mark, our primary evangelist in this liturgical year, covers a lot of territory in this short paragraph in the gospel lesson appointed for today. Jesus is baptized by John, anointed by the Spirit, confirmed by the voice of God, driven into the wilderness and “tempted by Satan,” waited on by angels, and then begins his public ministry in Galilee. We know the story, and each time we read it with an open heart, something different likely gets our attention. For me today it is the phrase: “. . . the angels waited on him.”

What does that phrase mean to me in my life right now, to you? Think about it. Angels, messengers of God, sometimes with flesh on them, come bringing gifts of courage, strength, fortitude, protection in the wilderness experiences of our lives. They stand with us when our fears and temptations seem ready to attack us as viciously as wild beasts. Jesus knew what that was like . Having had that experience, he encouraged us to pray: “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil,” knowing God would send the holy angels to lead us through the wildernesses facing us, whatever they might be.

Likewise because, in Jesus’ wilderness experience, he knew hunger and trusted God for his sustenance, he could tell us to pray: “Give us this day our daily bread.” Bread for the journey, spiritual bread to strengthen us on the way, is what the holy angels provide. God’s angels wait with us to see what we need to make it through the day, what sustenance, what protection is called for in the circumstances of our lives so that we may proclaim the good news of God’s love out of our own personal experience. As we begin our Lenten journey, let us open our hearts to welcome the angels waiting on and with us.
