ENCOURAGE ONE ANOTHER

In our epistle lesson, we hear the exhortation to “encourage one another and build up one another.” How well do we follow that admonition in our daily lives? Does God see us a “good and trustworthy” as the gospel parable describes? Do we use our gifts to be fruitful in God’s economy, or are we more like the “worthless” one in the parable, securing our giftedness for our own benefit?

Consider, if you will, your reaction and response when you hear someone criticizing or putting down another? Are you more likely to join the denigration, or do you encourage the victim of the diatribe? Think about a time when you found yourself in that experience. Perhaps it occurred in the context of your church community—the priest did or said something that didn’t go over well with some of the congregation, or there’s conflict in the vestry or in one of the ministries, or someone didn’t meet your expectations—we’ve all been there at one time or another. Reflect on your response.

God calls us to incarnate divine Love in all that we say and do. Yet we often fall short of a compassionate, self-giving response to those to whom we react negatively. It takes a positive attitude for us to go about encouraging and building up one another. When we are disillusioned, distressed, discouraged, it is difficult to find a positive attitude in our hearts. Paying attention to our blessings, to all the ways God works in our lives, can help get us on the right track. Asking God to open our eyes to the needs of others enables us to see where and when encouragement is needed. May we be alert to the opportunities to “encourage one another and build up each other” that come our way.
