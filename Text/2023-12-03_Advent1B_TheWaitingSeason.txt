THE WAITING SEASON

Advent is the waiting season, waiting for the incarnation of God to reveal Divine Love to us in ways we each can grasp. It is a season for joining the psalmist in his chorus/prayer today: “Restore us, O Lord God of hosts; show the light of your countenance, and we shall be saved” (or healed—both words have the same Hebrew root). Take a moment to pray it now on this first day of Advent; let the meaning of each phrase sink into your heart as you prepare for the coming of Christ.

In our gospel for today, Jesus calls us to be alert, to keep awake as we await the Divine Presence to come among us. It is an active waiting period, a time of expectation, a time of trusting in the faithfulness of God that Paul speaks of in our epistle passage. Isaiah’s image of the potter and the clay in our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures brings to mind the old gospel hymn: “Have Thine Own Way, Lord”:

“Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!

Thou art the Potter; I am the clay.

Mould me and make me after Thy will,

While I am waiting, yielded and still.”

Notice the trust shining through the prayer that starts on the third line and in the surrender at the end—what a powerful waiting stance it provides for Advent.

Return now to the palmist’s chorus, and let it become for you a vessel of trust in God’s healing, transforming grace during this holy waiting season.
