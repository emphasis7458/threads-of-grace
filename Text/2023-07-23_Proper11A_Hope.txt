Proper 11, Year A

Genesis 28:10-19a, Psalm 139:1-11, 22-23, Romans 8:12-25, Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43

HOPE

Jacob, in our lesson from the Hebrew Scriptures, experienced God saying, “ . . . Know that I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” As powerful as that experience was for Jacob, it is likely doubts and fears cropped up from time to time to shake his hope of return and reconciliation. Yet, because we have the rest of the story in the next five chapters of the book of Genesis, we know Jacob’s hope in God’s promise was justified. After a lot of water had run under Jacob’s bridge, he was indeed brought back to the promised land (Gen.33:18-20).

Moses had a similar revelation and promise from God in his encounter at the burning bush: “I will be with you; and this shall be the sign for you that it is I who sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.” (Ex.3:12) He too found that, in spite of all his trials and tribulations, he was able to bring the Hebrew people back to Horeb, the Mountain of God (Ex.3:1), to worship God as promised. His trust in God’s presence was vindicated (Ex.19).

Christian hope grows from such faith-filled stories. From scripture, tradition, and reason, we come to know that Christian hope is not just an idle wish that it won’t rain on our parade. We can be sure and certain that the Holy One will be with us all along the way as we are drawn home into the loving arms of God. The Rev. Canon Edward West in his “Litany of the Holy Spirit” says God’s Holy Spirit “gives us abundant hope,” hope in which we can absolute confidence. Such holy hope enables us to trust that we will find ourselves whole and holy, safe in the divine barn, ready to be made into bread for the world when the time comes.
