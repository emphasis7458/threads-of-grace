The Day of Pentecost, Year R A

The Day of Pentecost, Year A

Acts 2:1-21, Psalm 104:25-35, 37b, I Corinthians 12:3b-13, John 20:19-23

THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT

On that first Christian Pentecost, the Holy Spirit surprised folks in manifesting the Divine Presence as the rush of a violent wind filling the house, as tongues of fire appearing to rest on each one, as the ability to speak in other languages to get others attention, and separately as the breath of Christ. After the astonishment of such amazing manifestations of the Spirit, Paul, in the passage we read today from his first letter to the Corinthians, shows that the Christian community soon came to recognize the Spirit working in and through their lives in a variety of diverse ways and points out that “to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” That’s important to remember.

Take time to reflect a bit on the second lesson, noting if any of those gifts seem relevant to you. Think about the other ways you have experienced the Spirit’s presence in your life. Because I am a reader, for example, I have found the Spirit showing me the next book I need to read to deepen my relationship with the Beloved. Synchronicity, where the conjunction of unlikely circumstances show up together making some meaningful coincidence, reaches me and jogs me our of the rut in which I am stuck. I know that is the work of the Spirit. In reflecting of scripture, I may receive an insight about its meaning for me at the time that I’ve never heard or thought of before. It comes out of the blue, and I recognize the manifestation of the Spirit.

Shall we join the psalmist in praise of the Spirit:

“You send forth your Spirit, and [we] are created;

. . . I will praise my God as long as I have being

. . . and will rejoice in the Lord. Hallelluia!
