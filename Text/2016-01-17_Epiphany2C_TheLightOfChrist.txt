THE LIGHT OF CHRIST

Our collect for today (BCP, p.215) acknowledges Christ Jesus as the light of the world, the One who illumines the darkness of our world with his holy and life-giving presence, especially in Word and Sacraments, the One who radiates God’s love through us to the world around us, drawing each and all into the divine embrace.

Think about where you may be experiencing some darkness in your life right now. Perhaps it’s disappointment, loss, illness, grief, death of some kind. Perhaps anger, fear, anxiety have you in their grip. Maybe you feel lonely, ignored, snubbed, or betrayed. Possibly overwhelmed, stuck, lost. Or maybe it’s the national or world news that has you weighed down. When darkness becomes our perspective it is time to remember, from the prologue to John’s gospel (Jn.1:5), “The light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.” Christ Jesus, the Light of the World, has promised to be with us always no matter the situation, to love us through whatever challenges life brings our way. We can trust that.

Now take time to think about where you are experiencing the Light of Christ in your life. Maybe it manifests in your delight with the sunrise on your morning walk. Or perhaps it comes in a kind word in the grocery store or post office or wherever you go through the day. It may show up as you hold that new baby in your life, no matter whether you are parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle. Maybe you experience it through the patience and kindness of others dealing with your foibles; I know I do. However the Light may come, we are called to share it with others, letting the Light shine through the cracks it makes in our tough, self-centered shells.
