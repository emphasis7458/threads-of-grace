Proper 20, Year B

Proverbs 31:10-31, Psalm 1, James 3:13—4:3, 7-8a, Mark 9:30-37

DRAW NEAR

Our epistle for today promises that if we “Draw near to God, . . . he will draw near to you.” God is always near, of course, nearer than our very own breath. It is just that we are so often unaware of the reality of God’s indwelling, enfolding presence in our lives. How can that be?

Many of us for much of the time tend to live our lives almost on autopilot, perhaps as if our lives were self-driving automobiles, scarcely noticing the ups and downs of daily life. It may not necessarily be our intent to ignore God, but with the busyness of the day to day, that is what happens by default. Then one day, something untoward, maybe even devastating, happens, and we realize we are not in control, that our own personal resources will not suffice. At that point, we are ready at last to draw near to God, to let go of all the things we have allowed to separate us from the Divine.

That is when the Holy One, “unto whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid,” (BCP, 323) draws near to us. We can trust God to meet us where we are, as we are. The Beloved comes in whatever the circumstances of our lives may be to reveal Godself to us in ways we can receive, ways that are different for each of us in our uniqueness. As we experience the Divine Presence, we come to know deep within that “peace that surpasses understanding” (Phil.4:7). We are able to go forth with strength and courage to face whatever life brings us, finally knowing in our hearts that, as Teresa of Avila put it, “God alone suffices.” It is God who is the awakener of our hearts, and it is God who sustains us in our powerlessness to sustain ourselves. Our only response can be to draw near to God.
