The Fourth Sunday of Easter Year A

Acts 2:42-47, Psalm 23, I Peter 2:19-25, John 10:1-10

ABUNDANT LIFE

In today’s gospel, Jesus says, “I came that they (the metaphoric sheep, you and I, in other words) may have life, and have it abundantly.” How do you picture that abundant life? Through the centuries, people have seen it very differently from the example Jesus gave us. From the time of Constantine until recent times, the Church has seemed to assume that power was the defining aspect of abundant life for her, sort of a “my way or the highway” kind of thinking. Yet Jesus lived a life of humble service as he specifically demonstrated by washing his disciples’ feet at their last supper together.(Jn.13:3-17) More recently, the proponents of the so-called “Prosperity Gospel,” apparently see it as personal wealth, “the one with the most toys wins” kind of expectation. That’s not the kind of life Jesus led, however, as he and his disciples carried his itinerant ministry through the countryside, provided for by the women who followed along with them. (Mt.27:55, Mk.15:41. Lk.8:3)

It is hard for us to think about abundant life without being captured by our culture’s values. But Jesus’ life and message was countercultural from day one. Born homeless, quickly taken into exile, growing up and becoming ever more aware of his religion’s skewed priorities, his prophetic teachings, both by word and action, rankled those in authority. Their Sabbath rules, food rules, utensil washing rules, communication rules, unclean rules, all human boundaries were fodder that he used to open folks’ eyes to see what was important to God—LOVE.

In every situation and circumstance, it is Love that is needed, that brings abundant life into reality, individually and throughout the world. As we love God and one another day by day, trusting in the Good Shepherd to lead us on the way into harmony and wholeness, we discover the rich full, abundant life that flows from grace deep within.
