GOD’S HANDIWORK

The psalmist today points out God’s handiwork in creation—the awesomeness, the beauty that speaks a language all its own. In ancient times people’s lives were so dependent on nature, so enmeshed with creation that it was easy for them to recognize the hand of God at work in the world around them. The psalmist speaks for them: “One day tells its tale to another, and one night imparts knowledge to another. Although they have no words or language, and their voices are not heard, their sound has gone out into all the lands, and their message to the ends of the world.”

God’s handiwork continues to proclaim the message of divine Love for us today, but how often are we aware of it? We tend to isolate ourselves more and more with all the comforts of technology, the busyness of life that consumes our waking hours. Occasionally, the magnificence of creation may take our breath away, a glorious sunset, a panoramic mountain vista, a rainbow arcing across the sky between the sun and the rain, for example. For the most part, however, if we want to hear the language of God’s creation today, we have to make an effort. It takes intention and attention; it takes time; it takes silence; it takes eyes to see and ears to hear; and it takes going outside our insular little world.

When we are awakened to appreciate God’s handiwork in creation, we may begin to notice the early birdsong heralding the dawn of a new day, a tiny blossom transforming a weed into a wildflower, palm fronds dancing in the slightest breath of breeze. God’s handiwork is always here, calling our name, awaiting our attention.
