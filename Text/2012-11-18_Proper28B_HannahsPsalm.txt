HANNAH’S PSALM

The lectionary propers for today are unusual. After the first lesson taken from the Hebrew scriptures, we always have a response. That response is generally a psalm—or portion of a psalm--relating to that scripture passage. Today the response , although it is psalm-like, a song, a poem, is a following passage that illuminates the results of the heart-felt prayer found at the conclusion of the first lesson. It is Hannah’s prayer of thanksgiving and praise for the answer to her prayer, for the gift of her son, Samuel, who became one of Israel’s major prophets, the one who followed God’s direction and anointed David king over Israel.

Hannah’s song may sound familiar to us because it is so similar in style and vision to, and perhaps a model for, Mary’s Magnificat (Lk.1:46-55). Those who pray Evening Prayer on a regular basis likely find the Magnificat stored in their hearts, for it is said or sung regularly in that service (BCP, pp.65, 119).

As we ponder Hannah’s song, it is worthwhile to consider how our experience of God’s hand at work in our lives and in the world about us compares to hers. Do our hearts “exult in the Lord” when we recognize Gods’ presence in the here and now, turning things upside down, inspiring in us a countercultural vision of the vicissitudes of life, opening our eyes to see beyond the surface appearance, stretching our hearts with compassion? How might you and I express our joy at what we experience as the answer to prayer? Try journaling with your thoughts.
