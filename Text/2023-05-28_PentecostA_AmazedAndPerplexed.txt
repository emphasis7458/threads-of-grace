The Day of Pentecost, Year R A

The Day of Pentecost, Year A

Acts 2:1-21, Psalm 104:25-35, 37b, I Corinthians 12:3b-13, John 20:19-23

AMAZED AND PERPLEXED

Our first lesson from the Acts of the Apostles tells us that the bystanders in Jerusalem that day were amazed and perplexed when each of them heard the apostles testifying to “God's deeds of power” in their own native languages. They recognized that the apostles were common, everyday people, not well educated, well traveled, cosmopolitan men. They couldn't figure out what had happened, what it meant.

That is often our reaction to an encounter with the Divine. First, we are filled with awe, stunned with what we see, what we hear, what we feel. After the glow of the encounter starts to fade, we began to process the experience, to analyze what happened to us. We likely will be perplexed because this hasn't happened before, and we don't know what to make of it. That often happens to me in some event of synchronicity. I recognize it as an encounter with the Holy One, and I am continually. surprised that God uses these two unrelated incidents to get my attention. I am awed at what insight comes. I often feel the need to journal with the experience to see if there is more--and with God there is always more.

Take some time to reflect on some experience you recognized as an encounter with God, Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Notice your reaction. Were you amazed and perplexed? Can you begin to relate to the folks in Jerusalem on that first Christian Pentecost? Are you at ease with the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life today, knowing that the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each and all for the common good? Sit with that Holy Presence a bit, and respond as feels right for you.
