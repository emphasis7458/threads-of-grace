AMONG YOU

“Among you stands one whom you do not know,” John the baptizer tells the crowds questioning him. The same might be said to us today. We know he was referring to Jesus. Yet how aware are we of the presence of Christ Jesus in our midst? We may acknowledge it with our heads, much like the Geico TV commercials: “Everybody knows that.” But how often do we recognize the face of Christ in the other before us?

It is hard for us to realize that Emmanuel, Christ Jesus, is actually here (even though unseen) enfolding us with love as we go about our daily lives, transforming us day by day into the divine image we were created to be. It takes paying attention with our whole heart to get the merest glimpse; it takes listening with open ears to hear the word God has for us, always urging us to be compassionate and self-giving in our love to each and all. That means spending time with the Holy One during this Advent season in some intentional way. It’s good to let God know we are waiting with joyful anticipation to see what is being birthed in us as we prepare ourselves once again to celebrate Jesus’ incarnation, to welcome him into the manger of our hearts.

Whenever we experience the presence of the Divine in our lives, it is easy to follow Paul’s admonition to rejoice always. We are so full we can relate to the prophet Isaiah saying, “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God,” to Mary’s Magnificat: “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord.” We are changed—and charged with enthusiasm-- when we come to know the One who stands among us.
