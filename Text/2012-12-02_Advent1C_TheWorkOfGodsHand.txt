THE WORK OF GOD’S HAND

In our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures today, we read: “We are the clay, and you are our potter; we are the work of your hand.” That brings to mind a favorite old gospel hymn, “Have Thine Own Way, Lord.” Back in the days when I was in elementary school, when children opened each school day with scripture, prayer, and the Pledge of Allegiance, my second grade teacher taught us that hymn. It has stayed with me all these years. I often use it as on offering when I begin a Centering Prayer session. I offer it to you as an Advent meditation, a way of preparing for the coming of Christ.

Have Thine Own Way, Lord
Adelaide A. Pollard

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Thou art the potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after thy will,
while I am waiting, yielded and still.

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Search me and try me, Savior today!
Wash me just now, Lord, wash me just now,
as in thy presence humbly I bow.

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
Power, all power, surely is thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!

Have thine own way, Lord! Have thine own way!
Hold o’er my being absolute sway.
Fill with thy spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me!

Are you ready to offer the clay of your life into the hands of the Divine Potter in this Advent season, trusting those holy hands to transform you into the imago dei God created you to be?
