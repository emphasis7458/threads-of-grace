TAKE HEART

No matter how dismal life is, how lonely, how anxious, how sad, how frightful, how frustrating, Christ comes to take us by the hand and says, “Take heart!” God wants to bless us, to make us whole and holy, to fill us with God’s grace, to surround and uphold us with the peace of God’s presence.

Just look at all the examples in our scripture lessons for today and take heart. If we listen with the ears of our hearts, we may hear God saying, “Take heart, Abraham. It doesn’t matter that you are no longer young, that your wife appears barren. Come, follow me to the Promised Land, ‘and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.’” Or maybe we hear, “Take heart, Romans. There is a place for you in the Kingdom of God. So what if you are not Jewish? Just ‘Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight,’ (Prov.3:5) and I will reckon you as righteous just as I did Abraham.” Or “Take heart, Matthew. I know it hurts to be scorned by your brothers for working with the Roman oppressors. ‘Follow me,’ and your life will be turned around. Your story will touch the hearts of millions through the ages.” Listen; can you hear: “Take heart, daughter. Your physical suffering is over, and so is your mental and emotional agony. You are free from the burden of society’s bondage. Join the psalmist and ‘praise the Lord with the harp,…sing for him a new song.’” Or “Take heart, grieving father. Your daughter ‘is not dead but sleeping.’ The professional mourners are not needed. Rather now is the time to rejoice and give thanks to the Lord God for his mercy and grace.” And lastly, hear, “Take heart, precious child. It is not yet your time to pass on to the Father. Arise; take my hand. The future awaits you.”

Take heart, each and all! No matter how impossible life may seem at any given moment, “nothing will be impossible for God.” (Lk.1:37)
