The Second Sunday of Easter, Year C

Acts 5:27-32, Psalm 118:14-29, Revelation 1:4-8, John 20:19-31

GOD MEETS US WHERE WE ARE, AS WE ARE

How often have you heard me say that in “Threads of Grace”? I often share that with you readers because that is my experience. Grace comes to us in just the way we can recognize and receive it and realize its source. In the early 90’s, Marcia Hollis, in her book entitled God Meets Us Where We Are, gave me the words to name that truth. Only later, as it became clear that the Beloved reaches us in our own particularity, our uniqueness, that I added the last phrase to my understanding of and trust in God’s steadfast, tender loving care.

The apostle Thomas in our gospel today provides a perfect example of that truth. When he was absent from the first appearance of the risen Christ to his brother apostles, Thomas couldn’t accept their testimony to the resurrection. It must have seemed just too good to be true; it didn’t resonate with his experience. From his defense of his doubtfulness, it appears he might have been a sensate person (people who get their information about the world from their senses) who needed to see, to touch the reality of Christ for himself. Not immediately, but a week later, when he was again with the disciples, Christ appeared and reached out specifically to Thomas, offering himself in just the way Thomas needed, inviting him to touch his wounds and accept. Thomas was overcome by grace, by the self-giving love of Christ.

So too are we when we experience the reality of the Divine Presence enfolding us in Love, healing our pain and distress, strengthening us to step forward in faith. You know it’s true. Stop for a bit and think of one of the times you have experienced God meeting you where you were, as you were and give thanks.
