The Day of Pentecost, Year A

Acts 2:1-21, Psalm 104:25-35, 37B, I Corinthians 12:3B-13 , John 20:19-23

RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT

In today's gospel, John tells us: "[Jesus} breathed on them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.' " That sounds very much like God's action in the beginning: ". . . then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being."(Gen.2: 7) God's lifegiving breath is gift--all we have to do is receive it. Our task is to be open and available, ready to accept God's grace whenever, however it may come, breath, wind, pneuma, Spirit.

John the baptizer announced the coming of the One who would baptize not with water but with the Holy Spirit and with fire.(Mk.1:4-8) Heavenly fire is different from earthly fire. Earthly fire destroys, while heavenly fire creates and inspires new life. That is what we celebrate on Pentecost--God's heavenly fire empowering the apostles to go and proclaim Christ Jesus' message of love and redemption. As we allow God to breathe in and through us, we are inspired to love and serve others. We experience the heavenly fire consuming our hearts with zeal, with joy and delight, with God's peace.

May our hearts be open this day to receive the Holy Spirit as we pray:

"Come, Holy Spirit, come.

Come as the fire and enkindle in our hearts a love of the Lord Jesus.

Come as the dove and bring to our lives the peace of God.

Come as the wind and blow away the clouds of doubt and uncertainty

which would keep us from following Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior."
