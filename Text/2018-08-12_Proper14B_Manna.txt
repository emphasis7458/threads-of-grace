MANNA

From scripture, we know God provided manna in the wilderness, new every day, for the Israelites’ nourishment on their journey from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. Then in what we call the “Sermon on the Mount,” Jesus taught us to pray to the Father: “Give us this day our daily bread” (Mt.6:11), in other words, we ask for what it takes to sustain us in this life on earth, physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. We acknowledge our dependence on the Holy One every time we use that prayer, surely daily if not more often. And day-by-day we experience God’s grace meeting us where we are, as we are, with just what we need; sometimes we’re aware of that sustaining work in our lives, sometimes—maybe most times—not.

Take some time to reflect on the manna you receive in your life, on how the Beloved nourishes you on your way. For me, I recognize God’s Word as manna, however it may come, in scripture to be sure, but also in spiritual reading from our ancestors in the faith, as well as more modern folks who walk with the Holy One. From the beginning of my walk with the Beloved, one book after another has called my name and proved to be just what will lead me deeper into the Way of Love. All kinds of people speak God’s word to me—preachers and teachers, of course, and spiritual friends, but as unlikely as it may seem, I recognize God speaking in the mouth of strangers, or in those with whom I may be in conflict, or even in novelists or other writers. The Beloved uses whatever is available to touch my heart—and yours too.

Our collect for today prays that we “may be enabled to live according to [God’s] will.” God’s provision of manna is just one of the grace-filled enabling forces at work in our lives. Thanks be to God!
