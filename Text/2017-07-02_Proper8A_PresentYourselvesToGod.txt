PRESENT YOURSELVES TO GOD

Think about how you present yourself to God. When God called Abraham, as we hear today in our first lesson, Abraham answered, “Here I am,” hinneni in Hebrew. My Texas daughter was the leader of a Cursillo retreat this past spring, and this scripture was her theme. She created the design shown here with the Hebrew letters for “hinneni” to use on nametags, handouts, etc. to illustrate the weekend’s focus. When the Holy One calls, “Here I am” is the perfect response.

Scripture provides a variety of examples of how God’s calls were answered, of how those called presented themselves to the Beloved. Mary’s fiat, “Let it be with me according to your word.” (Lk.1:26-38), like Abraham’s hinneni, demonstrates the trust it takes to walk into the unknown with the Divine. Philip, chosen by the apostles along with six others, gives us another model for our response. (Acts 8:26-40) He heard the call to “get up and go” on the wilderness road. He didn’t ask questions; “he got up and went.” (v.27) Being responsive, he saw the Ethiopian eunuch in his chariot and heard the Spirit say, “Go over to the chariot and join it.” Again, no questions about why or what to say or do, Philip trusted God to make it clear one step at a time.

As we present ourselves to God with our “yes,” no matter how we may express it-–with word or deed—God will lead us on the way to accomplish the divine will for us and for the world.
