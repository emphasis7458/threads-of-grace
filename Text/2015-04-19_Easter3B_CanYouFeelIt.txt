CAN YOU FEEL IT?

Sit quietly for a bit. Settle down. Then reread the gospel passage for today, letting it unfold before your eyes. It is night; the end of a long, unsettling day. The lamps are burning; the smoke irritates your eyes. You are there with the others, overwhelmed by what has gone on.

Yesterday, everyone was in a state of shock, not knowing what to make of it all – this was not the way it was supposed to be. And today has been full of questions. Who knows what to believe? Early this morning, Mary Magdalene came rushing in to report seeing the Lord outside the empty tomb, describing how he had called her by name and sent her to spread the good news of his resurrection. Resurrection – how can that be? Who ever heard of such a thing? And now your friends from Emmaus have returned to share their experience of recognizing Jesus in the breaking of the bread at their house. They walked and talked with him, they said, but they didn’t know him all that while. That just doesn’t make sense. What’s going on?

Suddenly, there he is, standing among you, saying, “Peace be with you.” And it is, the peace of God that passes all understanding in a palpable way. All your fear, all your doubts, all your lack of understanding falls away as God’s peace envelopes you, fills your heart, comforts your soul. Can you feel it?
