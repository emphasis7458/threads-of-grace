Proper 18, Year A

Exodus 12:1-14, Psalm 149, Romans 13:8-14, Matthew 16:15-20

WAKE AND LOVE

Reading the Epistle passage appointed for today, two words jumped out at me: wake and love. Paul tells the Romans that “it is now the moment for you to wake up from sleep”, to love one another, following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. We need to wake up to God's infinite love for us, each and all, to recognize the embracing arms of the Holy One enfolding us, drawing us ever nearer so that we may experience the flow of Love circulating through the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

Remember the gospel song “It Only Takes a Spark”?

“It only takes a spark to get a fire going,

And soon all those around can warm up to its glowing.

That’s how it is with God’s Love:

Once you’ve experienced it, you want to pass it on.”

That's God's desire for us, to know the indwelling power of that Self-giving Love, such that we will be inspired to share it with, not only those near and dear to us, but even more so to those who are different, the others we are afraid we can't relate to. It is the Divine's transforming Presence that moves us to pass that Love on to those who need it today.

Now is the moment to wake from your soporific limitations. Pause and read the epistle passage again, slowly, prayerfully. Notice what word or phrase touches your heart in some way. Pay attention to the message God has for you right now. You may want to journal with your response to the One who calls you by name, giving thanks for all the ways God is working in your life and using you to carry out the day-to-day work of Love in the world.
