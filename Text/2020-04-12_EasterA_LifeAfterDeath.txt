LIFE AFTER DEATH

The good news of the Christ Jesus' Resurrection is that there is life after death. The new life will be different from the old life. In passing through death we surrender what has held us in sway as we move into the possibilities of what awaits in the new resurrected life. That is true no matter what kind of death we may be experiencing, physical death at the end of life certainly, but also emotionally as we go through all the various losses that come our way in this life, both major and minor.

The difference may be palpable to others as in our gospel for today when Mary Magdalene didn't recognize the risen Jesus until he called her by name. Neither did the couple on the way to Emmaus until he broke the bread (Lk.24:13-33), nor the disciples gathered in Jerusalem who thought he was a ghost (Lk.24:36-37), nor the disciples who found him on the shore of the Sea of Tiberias cooking fish for their breakfast (Jn.21:4-13). In our lives today, others may notice something different about us, but more likely the difference will be internal where we realize we are different in some unexplainable way and know we had nothing to do with bringing forth the new life that is growing in us day by day.

Life after the COVID-19 pandemic has run its course will be different, likely very different. We can't yet begin to imagine what upheavals we'll have to face as we move into this new life. What we do know is that God is here with us now and will see us through whatever rough places may come, taking our hand and lifting us up if we stumble or fall. That is the good news of the Resurrection. Nothing can separate us from the love of God who through Christ Jesus "overcame death and opened to us the gate of everlasting life."

Allelluia! Christ is risen!

The Lord is risen indeed! Alleluia!
