Proper 18, Year C

Jeremiah 18:1-11, Psalm 139:1-5, 13-17, Philemon 1-21, Luke 14:25-33

THE POTTER AND THE CLAY

The Jeremiah passage appointed for today reminds me of the old gospel hymn “Have Thine Own Way, Lord” written by Adelaide A. Pollard in 1907:

“Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!

Thou art the Potter; I am the clay.

Mold me and make me after Thy will,

While I am waiting yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!

Search me and try me, Master, today!

Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,

As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!

Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!

Power, all power, surely is Thine!

Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!

Hold o’er my being absolute sway!

Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see

Christ only, always, living in me.”

In elementary school in the 1940’s. we started each day with “opening exercises” which included the Pledge of Allegiance , perhaps a patriotic song, “America”, for example, then likely a scripture passage such as the 23^(rd) Psalm, and maybe a hymn. When I was in the second grade, we learned “Have Thine Own Way, Lord”. We must have sung it often because this is the only hymn I remember from those early school years. For some reason it has been a pillar for me over the years. My heart must have been ready to receive it even at that early age. Perhaps yours is today.
