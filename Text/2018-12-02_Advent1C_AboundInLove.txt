The First Sunday of Advent, Year C

Jeremiah 33:14-16, Psalm 25:1-9, I Thessalonians 3:9-13, Luke 21:25-36

ABOUND IN LOVE

During the season of Advent, we are looking forward to the second coming of Christ, preparing to meet him face to face, however that may occur. In our epistle lesson today, the apostle Paul prays for the Thessalonians of his day, and thereby for us here and now, that the Lord may “make [us] increase and abound in love for one another and for all, and . . . strengthen [our] hearts in holiness that [we] may be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.” It is perfect for our Advent reflection.

Take time to sit with that prayer for a bit; let it soak into your mind and heart. Hear it with the ears of your heart until it resounds through your very being. Let your self-centeredness begin to drain away as you are being filled with Divine Love. Notice compassion for each and all, near and far, rising up from deep within. See all creation, not just this fragile earth, our island home, but all creatures throughout the cosmos from micro to macro, with new eyes that recognize the interdependence of all enfolded in the presence of God.

This is not our doing. It is the work of God in our lives, transforming us into the imago dei we were created to be, sanctifying us in holiness and in right relationship with the Holy One, deifying us in oneness with Christ Jesus in the dynamic Flow of Love here and now and for all eternity. May we ever be open and receptive to and in harmony with the Divine Plan so that we may abound in love for one another and for all creation forever.
