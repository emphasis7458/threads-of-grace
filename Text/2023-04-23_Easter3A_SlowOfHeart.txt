The Third Sunday of Easter, Year A

Acts 2:14a, 36-41, Psalm 116:1-3, 10-17, I Peter 1:17-23, Luke 24:13-35

SLOW OF HEART

Christ Jesus, in the gospel for today, recognizes “how slow of heart” the couple on the way to Emmaus is. He didn’t leave them where he found them however. He opened their minds and hearts to understand the messianic scriptures, and when that wasn’t enough, “he went in to stay with them.” Whatever it takes to reach us who are slow of heart, Christ Jesus is willing and able to do. With the Emmaus couple, “he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.” Having seen Jesus do that on countless occasions, finally “their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.”

Christ Jesus doesn’t leave us where he finds us either, no matter how slow of heart we may be. Whenever we indicate any interest in knowing what God is doing in our lives as the Emmaus couple did, when we are ready and available, the Holy One meets us where we are, as we are. As we let go of our resistance and accept what Love has to offer us, we may feel “our hearts burning within us” as did our gospel couple. That was John Wesley’s experience at the Aldersgate Street church in London where he heard the word of God and realized “I felt my heart strangely warmed.” On the other hand, we are each unique and may “feel” nothing at all, but we somehow know somewhere deep within that we have experienced the Divine even if we can’t begin to put it into words.

Once our hearts are open to receive and welcome the Divine Presence, to recognize Christ Jesus in all the manifold ways that Love may manifest in our lives, we, like the Emmaus couple, will likely be inspired to share our experience with others. Hearts full of Divine Love are no longer slow but overflow with fountains of living water (John 4:14) for the thirsty of the world.
