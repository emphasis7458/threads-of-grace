The Fourth Sunday of Advent, Year C

Micah 5:2-5a, Canticle 14 (lk.1:46-55), Hebrews 10: 5-10, Luke 1:39-45, (46-55)

SERVICE

The author of the epistle to the Hebrews tells us: “When Christ came into the world, he said, ‘See, I have come to do your will.’ “ No doubt, he didn’t say that in those early days in Bethlehem, but as he grew in wisdom and grace, he came to recognize the self-giving love of God that we, each and all, are called to live into. Day by day as he matured in loving God and neighbor, he was being prepared for Gethsemane and his complete surrender, “Not my will, but thine be done.”

Jesus’ mother Mary was his example of living into God’s will. Before her visit from the angel Gabriel, she was planning to marry Joseph and live happily ever after in the culture of the day. Yet given the opportunity to serve, she responded with, “Let it be with me according to your word,” giving herself totally into the hands of God. Both Mary and her son gave their hearts, minds, and bodies to serve God’s will in utter self-giving love.

God calls each of us to a holy purpose and longs to hear the same response from us: “See, I have come to do your will.” The specifics of our calls to serve are unique, and thank goodness, “God’s will is always better than our own,” as the Forward Day by Day writer puts it on the day I’m writing this meditation. We know God’s will always includes wholeness and holiness for us and for all creation. The Holy One inspires us to serve in Love, with Love, and for Love as we seek to become a beneficent presence in the here and now.
