The Epiphany

Isaiah 6:1-6, Psalm 72:1-7, 10-14, Ephesians 3:1-12, Matthew 2:1-12

LOOK AROUND!

Look around! Christ is manifest here and now. When we open the eyes of our hearts, we are able to see Christ everywhere. All creation, great and small, testifies to the fecundity of Divine Love for, through and in the entire cosmos, from the tiniest crocus poking up through the snow to all the galaxies swirling through outer space.

Look around! That is our call to action from Christ Jesus when he urges “those who have eyes to see,” that’s you and me, to be alert, to pay attention to what is going on around us, to notice the joy and pain of those who are brought to our attention, to become aware of the oneness of all creation.

Look around! The light of the World has come to cast out the darkness that surround us, that keeps us bound in our prisons of unawareness, of uncaring, of self-centeredness. As the light dawns in our hearts, we begin to see the eternal purpose God has prepared for us and for all creation.

Look around! Realize the enfolding and indwelling Love of God at work in your life and the life of the world around you. Recognize that everything belongs and will be used by the Holy One to bring about what has been prepared for us from the beginning.

Look around; gather together; come to pray for peace, wisdom, and ever-increasing knowledge and understanding of this fragile earth, our island home, and to praise, worship, and adore Christ Jesus our Lord, who continues to incarnate Divine Love in our midst day by day.
