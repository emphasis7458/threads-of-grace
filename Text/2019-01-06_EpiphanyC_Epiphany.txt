The Epiphany

Isaiah 60:1-6, Psalm 72:1-7,10-14, Ephesians 3:1-12, Matthew 2:1-12

EPIPHANY

What comes to mind when you think of the Epiphany? Is it “Three Kings Day”, the day the “wise men from the east” arrived to honor the infant Jesus and which is celebrated as the gift-giving day especially in Latin countries and other cultures around the world as well? Or perhaps what gets your attention and fills you with gratitude is the reminder that, as Paul proclaims in our epistle, we are not left out of God’s plan for the chosen people, that “the Gentiles have become fellow heirs [with the Jews], members of the same body and sharers in the promises of Christ Jesus.” For some it may merely be the tradition that the Christmas decorations must come down by the twelfth day of Christmas, Epiphany. Or something very different; remember we are all unique in God’s creation.

For me, today as I look at the world around us, it is the words of the prophet Isaiah that touch my heart and give me the sure and certain hope of God’s merciful and faithful presence in it all: “For darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the Lord will arise upon you, and his glory will appear over you.” Can there be anyone who does not recognize how dark our times are or how much we need the light of God’s presence to show us the way? Thank Goodness we have Emmanuel’s promise to be with us always (Mt.28:20b).

If you happen to be in a particularly dark place in your life right now, you may find it helpful to sit with that verse for a while and let it soak into your soul. Receive and accept God’s presence however it may come, trusting the Holy One to manifest the Divine Presence in your life as you may need. May 2019 be a year of major growth for you in deepening your relationship with Christ Jesus.
