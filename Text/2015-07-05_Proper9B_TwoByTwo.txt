TWO BY TWO

“[Jesus] called the twelve and began to send them out two by two,” Mark tells us in our gospel for today. That appears to be the disciples’ on-the-job training, perhaps an apprenticeship of sorts, as they go out, as Jesus did after his baptism (Mk.1:15), calling people to repentance, proclaiming the good news, and healing the sick.

From the beginning of his ministry Jesus recognized the need for community. Going it alone, whatever our calling, is difficult, so he sent them out two by two. Two can encourage each other when the way is rough, comfort one another when either is discouraged or sorrowful. Two will likely have complementary skills and talents. Look at Moses and Aaron for example (Ex. 4:11-17). When Moses complained of not being a good speaker, God provided his brother, Aaron for his mouthpiece in their meetings with the Egyptian pharaoh. In the New Testament, we see Barnabus bringing Paul to Antioch to join him in his ministry (Acts 11:25-26), and when they separated, Paul recruited others to accompany and support him on his missionary journeys. Two working together often can accomplish more than either separately; their spirits are brighter; the load is lighter. In times of danger, one may provide needed protection or rescue the other, lift up the fallen and give the needed care, physical, emotional, spiritual. Just think about your own ministries and what a blessing it is when God brings just the right one to help you on your way.

Jesus tells us that “when two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among them.” (Mt. 18:20) As Jesus sent the twelve out two by two, he was with them on the way. We can trust Christ Jesus to be with us today as we labor together two by two—or three. Expect and look for his presence on your way.
