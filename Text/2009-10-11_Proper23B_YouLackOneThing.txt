“YOU LACK ONE THING”

If today you heard Christ Jesus say to you, ”You lack one thing,” to what would he be referring? Would it be your “many possessions” as it was for the man in our gospel lesson? For many people in our materialistic society, no doubt, that would be the case, but that’s not the only thing that keeps us from following Jesus. For some, it is likely fear or anxiety about the unknown, where the path will lead, what will be required that not spelled out in advance. For others, like Martha (Lk.10:38-42), life is too busy, too much to do with too little time to do it, for us to take time to sit with Christ Jesus as Mary did, to listen to his word, to walk in his way. Some, like Nicodemus (Jn.3:1-21), are so concerned about what people might say that they have to come to Jesus in secret so that their reputation in the community won’t be tarnished. Some of us may be more like the Gerasene demoniac (Lk.8:26-39) who need healing, deep cleansing from the legions of things that hold us in bondage, before we can step up to the plate with our “Here am I, send me” (Is.6:8b). Some probably are like the woman at the well (Jn. 4:5-26), who have yet to be at the right place at the right time to meet Jesus face-to-face, heart-to-heart. Whatever it might be for each of us, Christ Jesus, looking at us as he did at the man in our gospel, recognizing our difficulties, loves us and waits for us to be open to God’s saving grace.

Take a moment to be still, quiet. Picture yourself running up to Jesus and kneeling before him with your yearning heart held out before you. Hear him lovingly say, “You lack one thing.” Trust in that steadfast love. Allow him to show you what it is in your life that holds you back. Rest in his presence, allowing him to dissolve, to blow away whatever is an impediment to your life in God, and then, lacking nothing, come and follow him.
