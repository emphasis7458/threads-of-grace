The Second Sunday after Epiphany, Year C

Isaiah 62:1-5, Psalm 36:5-10, I Corinthians 12:1-11, John 2:1-11

"THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS"

The Psalmist's phrase: "your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings," ((38:7B) reminds me of Jesus saying, "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, ...How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!" (Mt.23:37). Today, I realized that "brood" is a collective noun, not singular--my eyes opened to see more.

Over the years through the lens of personal piety, I have imagined "me" under the shadow of God's wings. Even reflecting on my mola, a reverse applique created by the Cuna Indians in Panama, which shows a great quetzal, a bird representing the divine, with outstretched wings covering two people, one under each wing, I have often thought both as me, the masculine and feminine parts of me, the unconscious and the conscious parts, my shadow and my persona. Now I see that perspective as limiting the boundless love of God, in spite of knowing it applies equally to each and all.

"Brood" now sticks out like a sore thumb, pointing to the interconnectedness of all God's children, who are being called into union with one another and with the Holy One. As we look around us, in this community, in this nation, in the world, we don't see the expansiveness that brood calls to mind. Rather, we see division, separation, exclusivity stirring the pot under God's wings. How can we respond to this roiling? Perhaps being willing to accept that we are an integral part of God's brood, not just an individual all on our own, would be a good place to start. Sit with the image of the mother hen calling her chicks to safety under the shadow of her wings for a bit and see what comes to mind for you. Can you begin to sense a oneness in the brood?
