TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN

What coin? None of the lessons for today even mention a coin. The coin in question serves as a metaphor for our life with the Risen Christ, as we come to know him as “the way, the truth, and the life” that is unfolding before us day by day. From the gospel, we see that one side of the coin involves abiding with Christ Jesus and on the other side, from the Acts lesson, we find that in our life with Christ we are called to “get up and go.” Neither is separate from the other.

Abiding in Christ Jesus is making time to be present to the Divine, to be open and available to whatever comes our way, trusting the Holy One to uphold us in all the situations and circumstances we may face as we journey through life. It means allowing ourselves to be nurtured by Christ’s Holy Spirit who goes before us to make the rough places smooth, who leads us into an ever-deepening relationship with God. Consider what “abiding” in Christ Jesus means to you.

As we abide in Christ, we discover ourselves being inspired to “get up and go.” Like Philip in the Acts passage, initially we may see only the first step, and it might lead us into a wilderness, but as we are responsive to the call, the door opens and the way becomes clear, one step at a time. We can be fruitful in God’s service so long as we abide in Christ Jesus and pay attention to “the still, small voice of God.” (I Kgs.19:12) It is easy, however, to run off in some other direction that appeals to us and pour all our energy into that effort, only to find ourselves burning out. In our gospel, Jesus bluntly points out that “apart from me you can do nothing.” It takes both sides of the coin for us to be fruitful in our life in Christ.
