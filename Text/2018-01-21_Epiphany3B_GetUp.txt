The Third Sunday after Epiphany, Year B

Jonah 3:1-5, 10, Psalm 62:6-14, I Corinthians 7:29-36, Mark 1:14-20

GET UP

The first time Jonah heard God’s call, he ran away. The Holy One then got his attention by saving him from drowning; so that when he heard, in our lesson today, God call him to get up, he did. That seems to be a typical response to the prophetic call: “Who me? Surely not!” Moses (Ex.3:11), Isaiah (Is.6:1-4), Amos (7:14-15), all could not begin to imagine what God had in store for them, but they did eventually get up and go about honoring the call of Love. Their stories tell us that God is persistent and doesn’t give up until we get it, no matter how long it takes.

This woman in Rochester, NY, is “getting up” and helping the homeless as she has been doing for thirty years.

It won’t always be easy or all sweetness and light. There will be frustrations, disappointments, and discouragements along the way. The good news is, as Paul told the Corinthians, “the present form of this world is passing away” as God’s love is made manifest. Read again the beginning of the gospel of John (1:1-5). “The light [of Christ, of Love] shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not [will not, cannot] overcome it” so long as we continue to get up and answer God’s call.
