Second Sunday after Christmas, Year R B

The Second Sunday after Christmas

Jeremiah 31:7-14, Psalm 84, Ephesians 1:3-6, 15-19a, Matthew 2:13-15, 19-23

THEN AND NOW

Take some time to pause and read our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures, from the prophet Jeremiah. Try reading it again more slowly. Can we relate to the prophet's audience; can we imagine what they have been feeling? As our year turns from the agonies and despair so many have experienced in 2020, can we take comfort in Jeremiah's assurance to the people of Israel that God is at work even now in 2021?

During these last few days of the Christmas season, sit with the grace-filled images that Jeremiah envisions, and let them soak into your heart. Feel the peace and joy of the Beloved's presence rise up from deep within. Imagine yourself walking on a clear, unfettered path beside a bubbling brook of water, knowing that you are God's precious child, that the Holy One will gather you up into the arms of Love and keep you safe. Feel the delight that can't help but burst forth in your praise and song over "the goodness of the Lord". Experience your sorrow, your mourning, turn into joy and gladness as you find your life becoming like a lush, well-watered garden, trusting that "all shall be well" as Julian of Norwich proclaimed. Be satiated with the bountiful provisions of God in your life.

It is easy to read through scripture without noticing what it has to say to us today, assuming it was written for the people who lived long so long ago, not relevant to us who live in such a different culture. Yet we acknowledge in our prayers that all scripture is written for our learning. May this new year be a time of reawakening our hearts and minds to consume God's holy word with diligence, looking for the message addressed to us here and now.
