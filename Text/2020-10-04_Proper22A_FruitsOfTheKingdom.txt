FRUITS OF THE KINGDOM

Jesus, in today's gospel passage, speaks of "a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom." That is God's hope for us, individually and collectively. Those fruits seem to be in short supply as we look at the mess we have made in our world today. How can we possibly become such productive people and make a difference in the here and now?

God provides the soil, the seed, the light, and the water, all the resources we need to produce the fruits of the kingdom. We, however, appear to be at a loss when it comes to planting and nurturing the fruits to maturity in our lives. The Holy One liberally pours out the fruits of the Holy Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Gal.5:22-23a), to encourage us in our efforts of husbandry, frequently to no avail. We are all too often distracted by the loudness of the dissensions around us, by the strife amid the factions screaming to get our attention, to have the energy left to work in the Beloved's garden. All that negativity drains us dry. That is not God's desire for us.

When we are ready to become co-creators with God, to produce the fruits of the kingdom in our lives and in the world, we are called to surrender our lives into God's presence, trusting the light of God's love to show us the way. As Nan Merrill puts it in her Psalms for Praying, 119:111-114:

"When I meditate upon your light,

my heart opens with compassion for all life.

That is how the veil is lifted,

how the soul is filled with truth and light.

Then we will not judge others, and

we will radiate love and healing to the world.

For as we develop the capacity to love others,

we will lighten the fears of the world."

When fear is dissipated, the self-giving fruits of the kingdom will show forth.
