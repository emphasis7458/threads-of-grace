INSTRUMENTS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

The apostle Paul, in our epistle lesson for today, calls us to be instruments of righteousness, tools that God can use to accomplish the divine purpose in our world. That’s what Teresa of Avila referred to when she said, “God has no hands but ours, no feet but ours.” We are called to follow in the way of Christ Jesus, to be incarnations of divine Love in the circumstances of our lives, whatever they may be.

St. Benedict called his brothers to welcome all who came their way as if the visitors were the Christ, to live out the gospel message appointed for today. It’s the same exhortation we hear from the writer to the Hebrews, “Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it [unaware, KJV].” (Heb.13:2)

Picture for a moment Christ Jesus standing at our door, knocking (Rev. 3:20). How would we respond? There’s a lovely Tiffany stained-glass window in our Diocesan Cathedral, Christ Church, Mobile, AL, illustrating that passage. Not only is the door closed, there is no door knob on the outside. We who stand on the other side of the door are called to open the door of our hearts and welcome the Holy One, to be available to be used as instruments of righteousness, to remain alert and aware of the opportunities that open before us to be God’s hands and feet and voice here and now. No matter how unprepared we may feel, we can trust God to equip those called into divine service.
