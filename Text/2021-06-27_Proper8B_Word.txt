Proper 8, Year B

II Samuel 1:1, 17-27, Psalm 130, II Corinthians 8:7-15, Mark 5:21-43

WORDS OF HOPE

The fourth verse of Psalm 130, appointed for today, won't let me go. Perhaps it will speak to you as well. As I read: "I wait for the Lord; my soul waits for him; in his word is my hope" my eyes saw Word capitalized. The psalmist didn't have our advantage of having read John's gospel, which begins: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." Even so, he recognized the strength and power of the Lord's word in his day.

Reflecting on "In his word is my hope", I considered what words attributed to Jesus are most helpful for me. Certainly, "And remember, I am with you always [all ways] to the end of the age" (Mt. 28:20b) assuring us of Christ's continual presence in the here and now. And from Jesus' high priestly prayer in John's gospel (17:21), "that they [and we] may all be one. As you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may they also be in us", calling for the grace of our oneness with one another and the Divine. And in Luke's gospel, Jesus points out: "For, in fact, the Kingdom of God is among you." (Lk. 17:21b) The realm of God is right here, and there, and everywhere, whether we are aware of it or not. All these words of Jesus bring hope to my heart, as "I wait for the Lord."

Our experiences in life are different; our spiritual journeys are unique; I wonder what words of hope from scripture speak to you today. I hope you will be inspired to take some time for recollection.
