"THE LORD NEEDS IT"

In the Liturgy of the Palms gospel, when the disciples were questioned about untying the colt, their answer was: "The Lord needs it." That's all. It was sufficient reason for the owners to allow them to take the colt. The Lord needs us today, you and me, each and all of us, to follow Christ Jesus on the way.

We are the only hands and feet and voice that God has to incarnate Divine Love in the world. All too often, however, we miss the call, or we ignore it. Our attention is elsewhere. We are busy about our self-centered concerns, instead of thinking about how we can meet the needs of the Holy One in this place here and now. It is easy for us to assume we're too insignificant to matter much. Others can do the job better. Besides, we're tired, mentally and physically; we have no energy to spare. On and on it goes, one excuse after another.

The truth is we each matter. We all have a unique part to play in God's economy. Our part will likely be different in different stages, different phases of our lives, but if we don't take up our role, there will be a hole in the fabric of God's creation. Something will be missing.

It is time to empty ourselves of our ego-centered desires and ambitions and generously offer ourselves, body, mind, and spirit, for the Lord's use whenever, wherever needs be.
