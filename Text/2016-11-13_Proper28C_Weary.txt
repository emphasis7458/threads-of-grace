Proper 28, Year C

Isaiah 65:17-25, Canticle 9 (Is.12:2-6), II Thessalonians 3:6-13, Luke 21:5-9

WEARY?

The writer of our second lesson exhorts us, each and all: “Brothers and sisters, do not be weary in doing what is right.” But we do get weary, exhausted, worn out, burned out even, from doing the same things over and over and finding no end in sight. Even if what we are doing is good and true, the longer we persist in our old routines the rut gets deeper and harder to escape. Take some time to look at what is wearisome in your life. As you focus on what is weighing you down, remember Jesus’ compassionate invitation: “Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest . . . rest for your souls.” (Mt.11:28-29) How does that passage speak to you today?

As we reflect on the loads we carry, taking a look at our lesson from the Hebrew scriptures may encourage us with Isaiah’s description of the creating work of God. He reminds us to “be glad and rejoice forever in what I AM creating” because the Holy One did not stop creating at the end of Genesis 2. God’s creating action isn’t stagnant, isn’t ever in a rut, but rather turns things upside down, inside out from our perspective. Witness the prophet’s description of what we have come to call the “Peaceable Kingdom” of the wolf and lamb, the lion and ox, making everything ever fresh and new. God continues to create throughout all history and calls us to co-create with the Divine here and now.

We don’t have to settle for being weary of the way things are. We can respond to Jesus’ invitation with an expectant heart and discover how God’s service is perfect freedom.
