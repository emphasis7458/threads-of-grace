The Third Sunday in Lent, Year A

Exodus 17:1-7, Psalm 95, Romans 5:1-11, John 4:5-42

OUTWARDLY AND INWARDLY

Whether our Lenten practices are working outwardly or inwardly isn't nearly as important as whether they are changing our hearts. Are they leading us to turn away from all those distractions and diversions that have consumed our time and energy? Are they enabling us to return our attention to listening to the ever-patient Beloved?

A deep and soul-searching examination of our relationship with the Holy One likely will uncover areas where we fall short or miss the mark. No doubt, it will shine light on where we may need amendment of life. Once our heart is convicted by the need for change, we may realize it is time for us to "bow down and bend the knee and kneel before the Lord our Maker" as today's psalmist puts it and trust in God's great mercy to redeem our mess.

Outwardly, while we may attempt to change the direction of our lives, our experience with New Year's Resolutions, for example, gives us an indication of how that may go if we try it on our own. Real change comes from within, where God is always at work in our lives, transforming us into the imago dei, the image of God we were created to be. The Beloved will find that task easier if our hearts are open and available to the divine action, ready to accept and cooperate with God's love that is indwelling and enfolding us wherever we are here and now.
