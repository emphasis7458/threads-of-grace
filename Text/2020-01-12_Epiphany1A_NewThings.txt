The First Sunday after Epiphany, Year A

Isaiah 42:1-9, Psalm 29, Acts 10:34-43, Matthew 3:13-17

NEW THINGS

Our Creator God is always doing new things in us. It is exciting to see them emerge from deep within ourselves and from others in the world around us. It is often, however, difficult to allow a new thing to come forth, but we can trust the Beloved to be with us as we step out into the new thing that the Holy One has prepared for us to walk in. John O'Donohue, Irish teacher and poet, in his book: To Bless the Space Between Us has, on p.14, "A Blessing for a New Beginning". I have shared it with others in such a liminal space, and I offer it to you today to encourage your heart in this new year:

In out-of-the-way places of the heart,

Where your thoughts never think to wander,

This beginning has been quietly forming,

Waiting until you were ready to emerge.

For a long time it has watched your desire,

Feeling the emptiness growing inside you,

Noticing how you willed yourself on,

Still unable to leave what you had outgrown.

It watched you play with the seduction of safety

And the gray promises that sameness whispered,

Heard the waves of turmoil rise and relent,

Wondered would you always live like this.

Then the delight, when your courage kindled,

And out you stepped onto new ground,

Your eyes young again with energy and dream,

A path of plenitude opening before you.

Though your destination is not yet clear

You can trust the promise of this opening;

Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning

That is at one with your life's desire.

Awaken your spirit to adventure;

Hold nothing back, learn to find ease in risk;

Soon you will be home in a new rhythm,

For your soul senses the world that awaits you.
