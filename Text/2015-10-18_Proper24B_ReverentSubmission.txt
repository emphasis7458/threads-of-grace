REVERENT SUBMISSION

Our epistle lesson points to Jesus’ “reverent submission” on the cross, which reminds us that we are called to way of the cross, to the way of self-giving love. When we hear Jesus say, “And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself” (Jn.12:32), it is easy to think he’s talking about heaven, what we know as the throne of God, and relax. But considered from another perspective, from the here and now rather than the hereafter, he may be saying he will draw us up onto the cross with him, to surrender ourselves to the way of Divine Love, to live the cruciform life of reverent submission day by day.

Submission to anything is countercultural to the American Way. Our country was born in rebellion, refusing submission to the rule of the King of England. Independence is in our genes. From the time we learn to say “no” and claim something as “mine,” we rebel against authority of any kind. The whole idea of submission is anathema to us—it reeks of slavery, for Goodness’ sake. We much prefer to be in control, to assert, with Frank Sinatra, “I did it my way,” no matter what the issue is.

Perhaps it is time to reconsider our approach to life. My self-centered way or God’s self-giving way, that is the question. Pause for a moment, and take time to pray the Lord’s Prayer. Hear yourself say: “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” That is a prayer of reverent submission. It was Jesus’ prayer in Gethsemane, submitting to the Way of Love. It is the prayer that “never fails” according to Jan Karon in her Mitford series books. The late Rev. Al Durrance of the Order of St. Luke phrased his prayer of reverent submission as: “Thy will be done; nothing more; nothing less; nothing else.” Are you ready to make that your prayer?
