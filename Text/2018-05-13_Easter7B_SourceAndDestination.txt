The Seventh Sunday of Easter, Year B

Acts 1:15-17, 21-26, Psalm 1, I John 5:9-13, John 17:6-19

SOURCE AND DESTINATION

God is our source and our destination. From our first breath until our last one, we are on our way back home. One Easter morning years ago in Virginia, our priest stepped into the pulpit, and the first words out of his mouth were: “I am dying.” There was a loud gasp from the congregation, but thank goodness, he was not terminally ill. He was making the same point as Jesus in our gospel today, where he says, “I am coming to you (God).” We are, each and all, created in Love, by Love, for love, in the image of God, destined for eternal life with Love in “that place where our Savior Christ has gone before.” (BCP, p.226)

It is all mystery. We can’t begin to get our rational mind around how this can be. Yet once we experience the Presence of God in the reality of our lives, however different it may be for each of us, we can come to accept and trust the truth of God’s enfolding, indwelling love flowing through us and all creation. In our life in this world of time and space, we are called to incarnate that Love day by day, nurturing our relationship with the Beloved and one another near and far. As we recognize we are all one in the Holy One, our eyes and hearts are opened to realize that differences are no account to Love. In I John 3:2, we read: “Beloved, we are God’s children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when [Christ Jesus] is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is.” Like, not different; God’s transforming work will finally be completed in us.

May we ever be aware of the exigencies of our journey as we go through life, with the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection, trusting that the Beloved is waiting to welcome us home with open arms.
