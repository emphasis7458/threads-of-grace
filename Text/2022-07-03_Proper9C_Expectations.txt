EXPECTATIONS

Our lesson today from the Hebrew scriptures demonstrates the problems we create for ourselves whenever we have expectations of others, expecting them to do things the way we would, to think the way we do, to communicate the same way we do. We are each unique in God's creation, and we find that can cause difficulties in our relationships with others. Naaman is a good example. Fortunately, his servant had the courage to “speak truth to power”, to offer him a better way to respond to his perceived insults. And fortunately, he had the humility to accept the counsel.

Coming to accept “what is” in any situation or circumstance is a good beginning when our buttons are pushed, as Naaman’s were when his expectations were not met by Elisha. It is easy to be frustrated, to respond with anger and rebellion. Seldom, however, does any good come from such response. That likely results in bitterness, acrimony, divisiveness. Acceptance and expressing lovingkindness in some way primes the pump of reconciliation with the other who has not met our expectations. That is always God’s desire for us.

When we experience God's peace cleansing and healing our hearts of negative energy, we may begin to realize that it was our own self-centered expectations that set us off on the wrong path in relating to others. As we mature in our walk with the Holy One, we will come to recognize God's transforming touch in our lives enabling us to let go of our self-centered expectations of others. Once that happens, we'll be able to join today's psalmist in praising God: “You have turned my wailing into dancing; you have put off my sack-cloth and clothed me with joy. Therefore my heart sings to you without ceasing; O Lord my God, I will give thanks to you forever.”
