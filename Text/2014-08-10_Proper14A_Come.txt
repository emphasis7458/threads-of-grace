COME

Christ Jesus calls us today to come walk with him through the storms of life, just as Jesus responded to Peter on the stormy Sea of Galilee in our gospel passage. Whenever we start to sink in the slough of despair, Christ Jesus reaches out to catch us, lifts us up into the light of God’s love and brings us safely home. We can trust his saving grace. We can also trust his delight in our joy as we walk together day by day, if and when we respond to his call.
If we listen with the ears of our hearts, we may hear him say:
“Come when you are weary and frazzled.
Come when you feel like dancing.
Come when you think you can’t put one foot in front of the other.
Come when you need a playmate.
Come when all about you is an unholy mess.
Come when you want to share your joy and delight.
Come when the winds of change whip around your head.
Come when laughter bubbles up in your heart.
Come when there’s no other place to go, no one else to turn to.
Come when you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Come when you are confused and full of doubt.
Come when you need to celebrate the peace of God.
Come when there’s no way out and through seems impossible.
Come when your heart overflows with thanksgiving and praise.
Come when staying where you are is untenable.
Come giggling, come weeping, but COME! I am always waiting for you to step out and take my hand.”

Take time to sit in silence for a bit and listen with the ears of your heart. What invitation do you hear this day?
