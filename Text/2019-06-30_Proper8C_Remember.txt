Proper 8, Year C

II Kings 2:1-2, 6-14, Psalm 77:1-2, 11-20, Galatians 5:1, 13-25, Luke 9:51-62

REMEMBER

“I will remember the works of the Lord,” proclaims the psalmist, “and call to mind your wonders of old time.” It is good for us to join the psalmist, to read the scriptures day by day to see how God’s faithful people have perceived the action of the Holy One in the world. It helps open our eyes to the reality of God’s presence with us here and now, continuing to create, redeem, and sanctify just as in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.

A Benedictine practice that aids remembrance is to take time at the end of the day to look back and see where we have been aware of God’s presence through the day, when we were conscious of the Beloved at work in our lives, in the world around us. Some people find it helpful to journal with these remembrances to secure them in our hearts and minds. We may want to pray that our spiritual eyesight and hearing be sharpened to discover the Holy One in our midst. The more we notice the more we likely will become conscious of the Divine Presence enfolding us in the minutiae of daily life.

If we pause and look back over our lives for the last ten years or so after practicing the daily examen of consciousness for a while, we will begin to see how different we are, inside as well as outside, how the Beloved has been transforming us, healing us, making us whole and holy, bringing us into intimate relationship with God, as we are open and receptive to the divine ministrations deep within. Take some time now to reflect and remember your experiences of God’s steadfast Love in the daily as well as the highs and lows of your life, and be joyful.
