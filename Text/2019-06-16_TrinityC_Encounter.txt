ENCOUNTER

“On the heights, beside the way, at the crossroads . . . , beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance to the portals . . .” are likely places for us to encounter divine Wisdom, the Spirit of truth that Jesus promises in our gospel for today. In other words, where there is opportunity for change, when we are in times of transition, we may expect to meet God if we are open and alert to the possibility. God is there waiting at the threshold for us to notice the Divine Presence, but if our expectations of the Holy One are limited to a being looking something like the bearded old man on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or a king on a golden throne, or a stern, black-robed judge in a celestial court, or some such, we may miss the encounter and what it has to offer us.

Our hearts are where these mystical encounters with the Trinity of Love occur. So long as our hearts are full of fear and resistance, content with the status quo, unwilling to consider there is more to life than we are now living, we aren’t likely to discover the place of encounter. When, however, we are ready to risk the unknown, trusting that the way before us is surrounded and upheld by the love of God, we will be en-couraged by the Holy Spirit to step out in faith, finally to cross the threshold into what God has prepared for us from the beginning. The Divine Three-in-One, One-in-Three, whom we honor and celebrate today, invites us to join in the cosmic dance of Love, to recognize the Lover who enfolds us, the Beloved who leads us, the Love which indwells us every step of the way. As we move more deeply into this intimate relationship with the Trinity of Love, we will find our hearts opening as gently as a rose unfurls petal by petal. The encounter is just the beginning. The dance will make a difference in the world.
