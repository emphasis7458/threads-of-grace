Trinity Sunday, Year B

Isaiah 6:1-8, Psalm 29, Romans 8:12-17, John 3:1-17

ABBA! FATHER!

The Apostle Paul tells us that "When we say 'Abba! Father!' it is that very Spirit [of God] bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ." On this Trinity Sunday, we hear God recognized as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in one sentence from Scripture. We also know God in three aspects of divine work: Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier.

St. Augustine says the doctrine of the Trinity is all about mutual giving and receiving, Love, the Lover, and the Beloved. One in three, three and one; that is how God reveals Godself to us. That is how we experience God. As we come to know God, the Father, intimately as loving and caring parent, nurturer, the protecting one, we are led into a deeper relationship with God, the Son, Jesus Christ, savior, healer, brother, friend, the one who has gone before us to pave the way, by God, the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, the Paraclete, the Spirit of Truth, the inspiring one, the empowering one.

As we experience the power of God's Love working in our lives, transforming us into the image of Christ, the eyes of our hearts are awakened to God's majestic holiness, to our patent unworthiness. We know how Isaiah felt when he saw the Lord; we recognize our uncleanness. But just as God didn't leave Isaiah in despair, the Holy One cleanses us with God's steadfast love so that our hearts are filled with gratitude, worship, and praise. Filled with joy, we want to glorify God with all that is within us, to join the heavenly host in singing, "Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty, God in three Persons, blessed Trinity." (The Hymnal 1982, #362)
