LITANY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
Adapted from Edward N. West by Madeleine L’Engle

As an Associate of the Community of the Holy Spirit, I pray the following litany every Sunday. Some of you may remember that I shared it with the Trinity congregation several years ago. Because using it has helped me grow in the knowledge and love of the Holy Spirit over the years, I offer it to you in celebration of the feast of Pentecost. (To learn more about the CHS, go to www.chssisters.org.)

Holy Spirit of the blessed Trinity,
Very and eternal God,
Fount of all sanctity,
Gift of the Ascended Lord,
By whose gift of faith we know Jesus as Lord,
Who gives us abundant hope,
And fills us with the love of God,
Have mercy.

O Divine Spirit, by whom we are baptized into Christ
and made children of God,
Who seals us in confirmation as Christ’s own forever,
Who nourishes our souls
with the glorious life of our Lord in Holy Communion,
Who heals the sick, who guides the dying,
Giving your sevenfold gifts to all according to your will,
Graciously hear us.

That in true humility we may conquer all pride and self-sufficiency,
That we may be made poor in spirit,
That we may triumph over anger, revenge, and hatred,
and be filled with your strength and love,
That we may be sorry for all the wrong we do
and turn from all that is contrary to your will,
That we may be vigorous in prayer
and joyful in the study of Holy Scriptures,
That we may tell out by holy living the power and joy of our faith,
That by holy living we may have a holy passing,
Grant, O Holy Spirit.
