The Third Sunday of Easter, Year B

Acts 3: 12-19, Psalm 4, I John 3:1-7, Luke 24:36b-48

ENCOUNTERS WITH CHRIST

Pause and take some time to remember some point at which you became aware of being in the presence of Christ. Let the memory soak in as you let go of your resistance. Accept the memory with peace, and consider the feelings that arose in you at that time. I suspect they likely were the same feelings the disciples experienced in today's Gospel passage which describes one of the resurrection appearances of the Risen Lord.

Scripture says: "They were startled and terrified." Whenever we are surprised by the unexpected, we are startled, and when the surprise involves an encounter with the awe-filled presence of the Holy One, most of us can't help but be overwhelmed, stunned into silence. As we begin to settle into the Shalom that Christ offers, likely joy will rise up in our hearts, as it did with those first disciples, as we are thrilled with the experience. Even so, we may still wonder at what is happening to us, not quite able to believe we are really in the presence of the risen Lord, asking with Mary at the Annunciation from the angel Gabriel, "How can this be?" As we abide in that Holy Presence, Christ will open our minds to understand the scriptures, the Word of God for us here and now. The encounter will change our lives just as it did for those early disciples gathered that night in Jerusalem.

Encounters with Christ call us to be witnesses to the reality of God's love at work in the world today, always a surprise, always unexpected, always full of awe and wonder, always opening our hearts and minds to more. Having become witnesses, we are called to share our experience with others as the opportunities arise. Stay alert to see what opens before you.
