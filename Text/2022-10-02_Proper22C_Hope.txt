HOPE

Hope is one of those words that we use in so many ways that our understanding of biblical hope tends to be watered down. “I hope it won’t rain on the parade.” “I hope the plane arrives on time.” “I hope this blouse I just bought matches the skirt hanging in my closet.” “I hope my family can come for the holidays.” “I hope there’s not too much traffic on our trip north.” It’s sort of wishful thinking about the future, desiring a positive outcome about the unknown over which we have little or no control.

Biblical hope, on the other hand, is quite different. I well remember Canon Edward West of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in NYC describing the difference at a retreat years ago at the Community of the Holy Spirit’s retreat house in Brewster, NY. He spoke of the “sure and certain hope of the resurrection,” of eternal life in the presence of God that awaits us, each and all. Biblical hope is complete confidence in “the steadfast love of the Lord.” It is absolute trust that, in the words of that old gospel hymn by Civilla Martin, “ . . whate’er betide, God will take care of you. Thru’ ev’ry day, o’er all the way, God will take care of you.”

Because the author of our Lamentations psalm trusted in the power of biblical hope, he was not dismayed by the circumstances around him:

The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases,

His mercies never come to an end;

They are new every morning;

Great is your faithfulness.

“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,

“therefore I will hope in him.”
